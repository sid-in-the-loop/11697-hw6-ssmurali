Topic: Airline Baggage, Fees, and Ticket-Change Policies

This system will solve the real-life problem of helping air travelers understand complex and variable airline policies regarding baggage allowances, extra fees, and ticket change rules. These policies differ greatly between airlines, fare classes, routes, and passenger status levels, making them difficult to answer reliably without access to the original policy documents.

This topic is suitable for a RAG system because:
- There are thousands of possible questions that require retrieving specific rules from airline websites, contracts of carriage, or government regulations.
- The information changes over time and cannot be memorized or fully generated by the model without hallucinating.
- Many of the answers involve conditional or exception-based rules, which makes them non-trivial to synthesize without accurate retrieval.
