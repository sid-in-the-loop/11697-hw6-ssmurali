Air Arabia’s flexible baggage, booking, and check-in options enhance convenience and reduce stress for passengers from various countries by offering clear, accessible policies that support seamless travel planning and execution across global routes.	
1. Exceeding weight limits triggers additional fees (e.g., £20+VAT for >31kg, up to £200 per piece).  
2. Exceeding volume limits incurs extra charges per 5kg or 25000 cm³ bands.  
3. Fees vary by service: international standard (e.g., £30–60), express (e.g., £60+VAT), or domestic (e.g., £60+VAT).  
4. Combined overweight/oversize items incur all applicable fees (weight + volume + length+girth).  
5. Final cost includes base rate + surcharge at 150% of original rate + handling fees.  
6. Charges apply per piece, with no refund if shipment is delayed, returned, or collected from depot.	
The context does not provide information on how removing oversize handling fees would affect efficiency or cost structure.	
None of the provided context discusses a reversal of the policy or traveller behaviour changes if the rule were reversed. The information only outlines the current policy change and its implications. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine how traveller behaviour would change if the policy were reversed.

Passengers could contact the Carrier’s Contact Centre to request a specific seat or modify seating options during check-in, as seat selection is available at check-in (subject to availability and operational restrictions).	
Passenger could use the online form or contact Loganair via email (loganair@bigpartnership.co.uk) for support to change a booking.	
The passenger would have to pay the full checked-bag fee for the first bag, increasing their travel cost by the applicable fee (e.g., $100 for transatlantic Economy).	
The passenger would lose flexibility, as they could only check two bags (per piece concept), each limited to 23 kg, totaling 46 kg — but since their original total was 25 kg, they’d still be within the new limit. However, if the bags exceed 23 kg individually, they’d be rejected. No change in total allowance, but stricter per-bag weight limits.
