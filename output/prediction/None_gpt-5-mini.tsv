Specific features vary by partner location.	
I don’t have live web access to look up the current address for you. Do you mean the company’s registered (Companies House) address or the customer-service/head-office address shown on MyBaggage’s website?

If you want to find it now, check either:
- MyBaggage’s official “Contact us” page (usually in the site footer) — that shows their head-office/customer-service address and phone/email.  
- The UK Companies House entry for “MyBaggage Ltd” (or “My Baggage Limited”) for the registered office address.

If you’d like, tell me which type of address you need and I’ll guide you step-by-step to find it, or you can paste the address you find here and I’ll confirm/clarify it.	
Any checked bag over 90 × 75 × 43 cm is classed as oversized and an oversize (oversized baggage) fee will apply. The exact charge depends on your route and where/when you pay (online vs at the airport), so check Virgin Atlantic’s baggage page or contact the airline for the current fee.	
No. My Baggage does not accept alcoholic drinks for shipment from the UK — alcohol is listed as a prohibited item because of carrier, customs and excise restrictions. 

If you need to move alcohol, options are:
- Take it in your checked baggage (subject to airline rules and duty-free limits).  
- Use a specialist wine/spirits courier or bonded wine shipping service that handles excise paperwork.  
- Buy at your destination.

If you want to be 100% certain for your specific case, contact My Baggage customer service or check their “items we cannot ship” guidance before booking.	
One — Basic (Basic Economy) passengers are allowed a single personal item (e.g., purse, laptop bag) that must fit under the seat.	
You must pay the entire reservation (100% of the fare) with the Volaris INVEX card for the free checked-bag benefit to apply in Mexico.

PSA Airlines conducts the four-week paid flight attendant training at its training center in Vandalia (near Dayton), Ohio.	
Typically you get the booking confirmation (invoice/booking reference) immediately after payment. The actual shipping labels are usually emailed closer to the pickup date — normally about 24–48 hours before collection (occasionally up to 72 hours, depending on the carrier). 

If you haven’t received labels 24 hours before pickup:
- check your spam/junk folder and the email address on the booking,  
- log into your Send My Bag account to view/download labels,  
- contact Send My Bag support with your booking reference so they can resend.

My Baggage does not use a single carrier worldwide — it works with a network of international courier partners. Common couriers they use include DHL, UPS, FedEx (including TNT networks), DPD and Parcelforce, plus local national carriers in some countries. 

Which courier handles your shipment depends on the route, service level and parcel size. The exact carrier will be shown in your booking confirmation and on your tracking details; if unsure, contact My Baggage customer service and they can confirm which courier will be used for your shipment.	
C. May 7, 2025.	
Yes. Any international shipment of golf clubs needs customs documentation. My Baggage will prepare the required customs paperwork based on the information you provide (description, quantity, value, purpose — e.g., used personal clubs vs. new/commercial sale). For postal/courier services that usually means a CN22/CN23 or a commercial invoice. Note that rules vary by origin/destination (e.g., UK↔EU requirements changed after Brexit) and certain items (powered trolleys, batteries) need extra paperwork or restrictions. If you’re unsure, provide full item details when booking or contact My Baggage customer service to confirm what you must declare and supply.	
A Volaris customer earns 1 Altitude point for every $20 MXN spent on flights or services.	
You can add extra checked baggage online up until 3 hours before your flight’s scheduled departure. After that you’ll need to add it at the airport (usually at higher fees).	
On Volaris’s official website — see the Baggage/Prohibited & Restricted Items page (also covered in their Conditions of Carriage). You can also get details from Volaris customer service or at the airport ticket counter.

Avelo charges $95 each way for a pet in the cabin (fee is per pet/carrier). Reservations are required, pets must remain in an approved carrier that fits under the seat, and service animals are handled differently. Policies and fees can change — confirm the current price and rules on Avelo.com or during booking.	
Most guides list 22 inches (about 56 cm) as the most commonly allowed maximum height for carry-on luggage on major airlines (typically 22 x 14 x 9 in, measured including wheels and handles).	
The maximum size is 62 linear inches (158 cm) total (length + width + height).	
A standard checked bag on Frontier must not exceed 62 linear inches (length + width + height) / 157 cm, and it must weigh no more than 50 lb (23 kg).	
Transit times vary by destination and service, but for international removals by sea My Baggage typically quotes around 4–8 weeks (air options are much quicker, usually days rather than weeks).	
SkyWest’s initial new‑hire flight attendant training runs about five weeks (roughly 35 days) and is held at SkyWest’s Training Center in St. George, Utah. Check SkyWest Careers or your offer packet for the most current details.	
I don’t have updates past June 2024, so I can’t confirm a rule that took effect January 3, 2025. As of my last update, Air Canada’s Basic/Lowest fares normally include only one personal item (that fits under the seat); a standard carry‑on bag had to be purchased separately. 

To be certain for tickets purchased on/after Jan 3, 2025, check Air Canada’s official baggage policy or your booking confirmation (Air Canada website > Travel info > Baggage), or paste the policy text or a link here and I’ll read it and confirm.	
D. 7 kg.

A. 50 kg.	
My Baggage advertises savings of up to about 60% compared with booking directly with UPS (actual savings vary by route, size/weight and timing—typically in the ~40–60% range).	
I’m sorry — I can’t confirm that specific July 2025 date from my training (knowledge cutoff June 2024) and I don’t have live web access right now. I don’t want to guess.

If you can paste a source or let me search the web, I’ll find the exact launch date. Alternatively, you can check Volaris’ press releases or the “newsroom”/investor relations section on their website for the official announcement.	
Volaris allows infants to travel on an adult’s lap from 7 days of age (infants are considered lap infants until 2 years old). Policies and documentation/fee requirements can change, so before you travel call Volaris or check their website to add the infant to the reservation and confirm any ID, health certificates or fees needed.	
Under Volaris Basic fare the personal item and carry‑on together may weigh up to 10 kg (about 22 lb) combined.	
ANA Mileage Club — ANA’s frequent‑flyer program lets members earn and redeem miles (on ANA and partner flights, credit cards, hotels, shopping, upgrades, etc.).	
My Baggage’s limits vary by carrier and service, but for standard door‑to‑door luggage shipments to Canada the usual maximum is around 30–32 kg (66–70 lb) per item. Heavier items can often be shipped as freight (with different pricing and handling) but require a bespoke quote — so check the My Baggage quote tool or contact their customer service to confirm the exact limit and cost for your shipment.	
Volaris Plus (domestic Mexico) includes a cabin bag (up to 10 kg; typical dimensions 55×40×25 cm) plus one checked bag (one piece up to 25 kg). A small personal item is also allowed. Check Volaris for current limits and dimensions.	
If selected you must complete and pass a TSA fingerprint‑based criminal background check (CHRC) — the TSA security screening/fingerprint clearance required for unescorted access to secure airport areas.	
I don’t have live access to My Baggage’s current site, so I can’t confirm the exact, up‑to‑date limit. Typically My Baggage’s parcel/student service allows about 20–30 kg per box/suitcase for door‑to‑door courier shipments (30 kg is a common maximum). Larger/heavier items are usually handled via pallet or sea freight with higher limits but different pricing.

To be certain:
- Check My Baggage’s Student Shipping/FAQ page or use their online quote tool (mybaggage.com).
- Or contact their customer service (email/chat/phone) and ask about the maximum weight per parcel and any overweight charges.

If you want, tell me the country pair and parcel size you’re planning and I can give more targeted guidance on likely limits and costs.	
They will still be allowed one personal item (a small under‑seat bag) for free.	
easyJet — you may bring one cabin bag (size limits apply but no weight limit is specified) and you are not allowed a second personal item unless you pay for an additional cabin-bag allowance or buy certain seats/fare types.	
My Baggage is a good choice for people moving abroad because it combines the practical services and protections movers need with simple online booking and lower cost than airline excess. Key reasons:

- Specialised international service: built for long-distance and cross‑border moves (students, expats, seasonal movers) rather than just domestic parcel delivery.  
- Door‑to‑door collection and delivery: they pick up from home/university and deliver to the destination address, removing the need to lug boxes to airports or depots.  
- Customs and documentation support: they handle paperwork and customs clearance for international shipments, reducing delays and hassle.  
- Flexible sizing and weight options: you can send single suitcases, boxes, sports equipment or larger consignments and scale up to full house moves.  
- Cheaper than airline baggage: shipping is typically far less expensive than paying airline excess or shipping items as extra baggage.  
- Tracking and insurance: online tracking and insurance options give visibility and financial protection in transit.  
- Packing guidance and optional materials: advice and packing services help protect belongings for long journeys.  
- Experienced customer support and student discounts: support tailored to common expatriate and student needs, with competitive offers.

Together these features make moving abroad simpler, more reliable and often more economical than alternatives.	
Because it offers a cheaper, more flexible and more convenient way to move suitcases and items than paying airlines to check extra bags. Instead of airport check‑in rules and overweight/oversize fees, My Baggage ships luggage door‑to‑door (or to convenient drop‑off/pick‑up points), handles oversized or specialty items (sports kit, instruments), provides online booking, tracking and insurance, and deals with customs/logistics. Those features remove airport queues, airline size/weight limits and costly excess charges, so it’s marketed as a practical alternative to airline baggage.	
Travelpro’s Terms of Use balance two goals: let customers browse, buy, post, and otherwise use the site, while protecting Travelpro from legal risk. They do this through a set of common contractual devices:

- Scope and conditions of use: the terms state that access and use of the site are allowed only on the terms set out (e.g., age and lawfulness requirements). That lets customers engage but gives Travelpro a contractual basis to suspend or terminate misuse.

- License and intellectual‑property rules: users are granted limited rights to view and use content, while Travelpro retains ownership of trademarks, text, images and code. This permits normal customer activity but prevents copying or republishing that could harm the company.

- Disclaimers of warranties: the site and its content are provided “as is” and “as available,” with no warranties as to accuracy, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose. That reduces Travelpro’s exposure for mistakes or interruptions.

- Limitation of liability: the terms cap or exclude Travelpro’s liability for certain types of loss (e.g., indirect, incidental, consequential damages) and often limit remedies to refunds or corrections. That restricts the company’s financial exposure if something goes wrong.

- Indemnification: users agree to indemnify Travelpro for claims arising from their misuse of the site or breach of the terms. This shifts legal costs and risk for certain claims back to the user.

- Third‑party content and links: Travelpro disclaims responsibility for content or transactions on third‑party sites and for goods/services sold by third parties. That avoids liability for outside vendors or linked resources.

- Dispute‑resolution and governing‑law clauses: the terms typically include a choice of law and may require arbitration or a specific forum, and sometimes waive class actions. Those provisions limit the kinds of lawsuits and legal forums Travelpro may face.

- Right to modify and terminate: Travelpro reserves the right to change the site and the terms or to block access. That allows the company to respond to problems quickly and limit ongoing exposure.

Together these provisions let customers use the website for browsing, purchasing, and interacting while creating contractual rules that reduce Travelpro’s potential legal and financial liability.	
Because My Baggage’s partner couriers and airlines charge by size and weight (and often by volumetric weight), accurate bike measurements determine the correct packaging, handling and freight band — and therefore the correct price.

Key points:
- Couriers price shipments using actual weight, dimensional (volumetric) weight and fixed “oversize/heavy” bands. A slightly larger dimension can move a shipment into a much higher price bracket.
- Whether a bike fits a standard bike box, needs a larger crate, or requires special handling depends on its packed dimensions and weight. Those choices change the cost and logistics.
- Accurate measurements let My Baggage give a reliable quote up front, choose the correct packaging and carrier service, avoid underquoting, and prevent extra charges, delays or refusals at drop‑off or transit.
- Conversely, incorrect or estimated sizes can lead to price adjustments, unexpected surcharges, or the need to rebook at higher cost once the true size is verified.

In short: their pricing model is driven by the carrier rates that are size/weight based, so precise measurements are essential to provide an accurate price and smooth service.	
Three. The Flybe brand has been used by the original Flybe (the long‑running airline tracing back to Jersey European Airways), by other operators that flew Flybe‑branded services under franchise/wet‑lease arrangements, and by the relaunched Flybe (the new company that began operations in 2022).	
Which airline or carrier do you mean? Excess-baggage rates vary by airline, fare class and date — tell me the airline (and travel date/class if known) and I’ll look up the per‑kg charge for departures from India to Dubai.	
The fee is $75 per person for same‑day flight changes on American Airlines for travel within the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Waivers/eligibility may apply for elite members or certain fares.)	
It won’t — transborder routes are exempt. Air Canada said the Basic (lowest) fare change won’t apply to flights between Canada and the United States, so travellers on Canada–U.S. routes booking a Basic fare will still be allowed to bring a standard carry‑on (plus a personal item). The removal of the free carry‑on applies to other markets only; on those routes passengers would need to pay or upgrade to include a carry‑on.	
Short answer: A wide range of baggage, booking, and check‑in choices generally improves passenger experience by allowing cost control, personalization and faster processing — but the real effect depends on the departure country’s airport facilities, local rules and the clarity/consistency of the options offered. That mix can either make travel smoother or create confusion.

How the options influence experience

- Flexibility and cost control
  - Ability to add or remove checked baggage, choose seats, buy priority boarding etc. lets price‑sensitive travelers pay only for what they need and business travelers buy convenience.
- Time savings and convenience
  - Online/mobile check‑in, self‑service kiosks and dedicated bag drop lines reduce queueing and speed up airport flow where those facilities exist.
- Personalization and predictability
  - Clear, modular ancillaries let families, sports/medical equipment owners or frequent flyers tailor services (extra bags, seat selection, priority) to their needs.
- Reduced stress through pre‑purchase
  - Pre‑paying baggage and printing/downloading boarding passes avoids surprises at the airport (fees, long lines).
- Potential downsides when offerings vary
  - If options, allowances or fees differ between countries or routes, passengers may be confused, leading to unexpected charges or delays.
  - Limited infrastructure at smaller airports (no kiosks, limited staff, fewer payment methods) can negate the benefits of digital/ancillary options.
  - Language, customer‑service availability and differing local regulations (security, size/weight limits) affect how smoothly options can be used.

Country-dependent factors that matter
- Airport infrastructure: major hubs support mobile check‑in and fast bag drops; smaller airports may require counter check‑in.
- Local rules and screening: some countries impose stricter baggage rules or documentation checks that affect check‑in times.
- Payment/currency and support: ability to buy add‑ons in local currency, local call centers and languages affects usability.
- Variation in allowances by route or country: regional short‑haul routes often have tighter limits than international routes.

Practical tips for travelers
- Check country/route‑specific baggage rules and fees before travel.
- Pre‑pay baggage and choose seats online when possible.
- Use the airline app or online check‑in to save time.
- Arrive earlier at airports with limited self‑service options.
- Keep screenshots/receipts of purchases and verify local contact info.

Bottom line: If communicated clearly and supported by airport facilities, a broad set of choices enhances control, convenience and satisfaction; if inconsistent or poorly explained across countries, it can cause confusion and extra costs.	
Short answer
Exceeding both a bag’s weight and its dimensional (volume) limits usually makes your shipment significantly more expensive — sometimes dramatically — because carriers will (a) charge by the higher “chargeable weight” (actual vs volumetric), (b) add overweight/oversize handling surcharges, and (c) often require reclassification to a freight/pallet or “special” service that has much higher minimums and different pricing. The exact outcome depends on the Send My Bag service you picked.

How it works in practice
- Chargeable weight: Courier-type services use chargeable weight = max(actual weight, volumetric weight). If your bag is both heavy and bulky, the carrier will bill you on whichever produces the higher weight (often the volumetric conversion), so you can end up paying far more than the physical kilos.
- Overweight surcharges / per-piece limits: Many services have a per-piece weight cap. If you exceed that cap you will face an overweight fee or you’ll be refused and required to rebook the item as a “freight” piece. Overweight fees are added on top of the base rate.
- Oversize handling and palletisation: If dimensions exceed courier limits, the item may need special handling or pallet freight. Pallet/piece freight carries higher handling fees and different (usually higher) per-kg or per-m3 rates and minimum charges.
- Reclassification to a different service: Heavy/oversized consignments are often moved from a standard door-to-door courier product to air/sea freight. Freight pricing is usually by m3 (sea) or by freight weight (air) with higher minimums and additional admin and collection/delivery fees.
- Additional administrative and return fees: There can be re‑weigh/re-dimension fees charged at drop-off or on arrival, plus costs if the item must be returned or repacked.

Typical differences by service type
- Express/courier (door-to-door): Priced by chargeable weight (volumetric rules). Expect volumetric billing, overweight surcharges, or refusal if above the per-piece cap; additional handling fees for very large items.
- Air freight: Often uses volumetric conversions too but has different thresholds and minimums. Heavy/oversized pieces may require palletisation and attract pallet fees and higher per‑kg rates.
- Sea freight: Mostly charged by volume (m3). Exceeding volume simply means you pay for extra cubic metres, or you may need a half/full container at a much higher fixed cost. Weight matters for handling but is less likely to be the main billing driver.
- Special/equipment shipments (bikes, skis, instruments): These have their own limits and surcharges; exceeding their limits -> special handling fees or freight refit.

What customers should expect
- Final cost can be the original booking price + one or more of: volumetric up‑charge, overweight surcharge, oversize handling fee, pallet or freight reclassification with higher minimums, and administrative fees.
- In many cases the extra charge can be several times the quoted rate if the shipment is large enough to trigger freight pricing or a full pallet/container minimum.

How to avoid surprises
- Check the per-piece weight and maximum dimensions for the chosen service.
- Calculate volumetric weight (L×W×H ÷ carrier divisor) and compare to actual weight.
- If you’re close to limits, contact Send My Bag for a special quote or choose the correct freight service up front.
- Repack, redistribute, or split items to stay within limits where possible.

If you want, tell me the service you booked and the bag’s weight and dimensions and I’ll explain exactly how your final cost is likely to change.	
Removing oversize handling fees for items >117 cm would have tradeoffs — it would simplify pricing and likely increase demand and customer satisfaction, but it would also shift costs and create operational strains unless the company adapts. Key impacts:

Operational / efficiency effects
- Booking and conversion: simpler rules reduce friction and increase bookings for large items.
- Hub and last‑mile handling: more manual lifts, pallet moves and non-standard handling will increase handling time per shipment and slow throughput at hubs and depots.
- Vehicle utilization: large items consume more volumetric space, so trucks/aircraft will reach volumetric capacity faster and routes may carry fewer paid shipments per trip, reducing load efficiency.
- Routing and mode changes: more oversize items may push a higher share to slower/cheaper modes (sea/LTL) or require special routing, complicating network planning.
- Damage/claims and insurance: oversized goods are more prone to damage and claims, increasing processing time and claim costs.

Cost structure changes
- Revenue loss from eliminated fee: direct short‑term reduction in per‑shipment revenue on oversized items.
- Variable cost increase: higher handling, packaging, equipment (pallets, liftgates), and carrier surcharges the company must absorb unless renegotiated.
- Margin pressure: unless offset, margins on oversized consignments will fall — could be especially severe on long international legs where carriers already charge oversize fees.
- Fixed cost investment: likely need to invest in infrastructure (handling equipment, storage configuration) to avoid long‑term inefficiencies.
- Carrier relationships: carriers often impose oversize charges; Send My Bag will either pay them (raising costs) or need new commercial terms.

Network efficiency implications
- Throughput per shift/route will likely drop unless capacity or processes are changed, increasing cost per successfully delivered parcel.
- Congestion at hubs and increased handling time can reduce overall network velocity and increase transit times.
- If volume grows, there can be scale economies, but only if the company can re-optimize routes, renegotiate carrier rates, and absorb initial investments.

Business and strategic effects
- Competitive advantage and market share gains are possible if volume increases enough to offset higher per‑item costs.
- May encourage customers to ship larger, heavier items, changing the product mix and average revenue per order.
- Unsustainable long term without cost recovery mechanisms (higher base prices, dimensional pricing, minimums).

Mitigation options
- Replace a flat oversize fee with dimensional‑weight or pallet pricing so large items pay for the space they consume.
- Offer a separate “oversize” service (slower, cheaper modal options) or require pre‑booking/appointment handling.
- Renegotiate carrier contracts or create dedicated LTL/sea corridors for oversize shipments.
- Invest in hub equipment and automation, and optimize route planning to recover throughput.
- Apply size or destination caps where costs are prohibitive.

Bottom line: removing oversize fees improves customer experience and can grow volume, but without compensating pricing changes, operational investments, or carrier re‑pricing, it will reduce margins and likely decrease network efficiency because oversized items consume disproportionate handling and volumetric capacity.	
Short answer: many travellers would shift back toward carry‑on‑only travel, raising demand for Basic/cheapest fares, reducing checked‑bag purchases and baggage‑claim time but increasing overhead‑bin crowding and boarding friction. Air Canada would likely lose some ancillary bag revenue but regain price‑sensitive customers and market share on Canada–US routes.

Key passenger behaviour changes

- More carry‑on‑only trips: price‑sensitive leisure and short‑business travellers would be likelier to buy the lowest fare because they could still bring a full-size rollaboard. That reduces incentive to check a bag.
- Fewer checked bags per pax: checked‑baggage purchases and gate‑checking would fall, cutting time in check‑in and at baggage claim and reducing mishandled‑bag complaints.
- Greater use of carry‑on for valuables/duty‑free: cross‑border travellers often prefer to keep purchases and valuables with them; allowing full carry‑ons increases that behaviour and speeds deplaning/immigration.
- Stronger demand for Basic fares and possible modal shifts: some travellers who had chosen competitors (or driving) because of the stricter rule would switch back to Air Canada, boosting bookings on Canada–US sectors.
- Boarding/overhead bin crowding: more full carry‑ons increases competition for bin space, likely more gate‑checking of bags at boarding, longer boarding times, and more passenger friction over space.
- Impact by traveller type: business travellers and solo short‑trip leisure travellers are the biggest winners (less need to check bags). Families and longer‑stay travellers may still check larger suitcases.
- Trip planning and arrival choices: passengers may arrive later to the airport and spend less time at baggage claim, changing spending patterns in terminals.

Operational and commercial consequences

- Ancillary revenue mix shifts: lower checked‑bag fee revenue could be partly offset by higher ticket volumes, upsells (seat selection, priority boarding) or new ancillaries. Competitors may mirror the change, pressuring fares.
- On‑time performance and boarding metrics: boarding may slow and turnaround risks could rise unless airline/agents enforce carry‑on size or promote priority boarding for those with overhead space.
- Customer satisfaction and complaints: overall satisfaction may rise among Basic‑fare buyers but complaints about overhead‑bin space and gate disputes will probably increase.
- Competitive dynamics: reverting the rule reduces a differentiator used by competitors to attract customers and may stabilize Air Canada’s share on cross‑border routes.

What to monitor (if evaluating the policy change)
- Checked‑bag rate and checked‑bag revenue per passenger
- Ancillary revenue mix (priority boarding, seat fees)
- Load factor and bookings on Canada–US routes
- Boarding time per flight and on‑time departures
- Overhead‑bin related complaints and gate‑checked bag counts
- Customer satisfaction/NPS for Basic‑fare passengers

Net effect
Allowing full carry‑ons again would make Air Canada more attractive to budget‑minded Canada–US travellers, reduce checked‑bag volumes, and likely raise bookings on short routes, while increasing overhead‑bin crowding and boarding friction and reducing some ancillary bag revenue unless offset by other upsells.	
British Airways’ baggage rules push travellers to weigh a few trade-offs: per‑bag weight limits, steep overweight/extra‑bag charges (and usually higher airport prices), versus the per‑kg/door‑to‑door pricing and convenience of a specialist shipper like Send My Bag. That structure affects the choice in a few predictable ways:

- If you’re only a few kilos over the airline’s allowance
  - it can be cheapest to redistribute items between travellers or pay the airline’s overweight fee (or prepay an extra bag online if cheaper). Small overweights are often the simplest to fix at the airport or online.
- If you have substantially more weight or bulky items
  - the airline’s overweight or extra‑bag charges can add up quickly, making a courier service that charges by total weight/size (like Send My Bag) much more cost‑effective.
- Time and convenience matter
  - BA checked luggage arrives with you at the carousel (useful if you need items immediately). Send My Bag is door‑to‑door but can take days and requires planning.
- Other practical factors
  - check restrictions (hazardous items, customs duties), insurance, tracking and pickup/drop‑off convenience. Specialist shippers often include basic insurance and tracking; airlines’ lost‑baggage handling differs.
- How to decide quickly
  - get BA’s overweight/extra‑bag quote for your route and compare it with a Send My Bag quote for the total weight/size. Factor in timing (do you need the items on arrival?), convenience and any restricted items.

Rule of thumb: for a small excess (a few kilos) pay the airline or rearrange; for many extra kilos or bulky gear, advance shipping with Send My Bag is often cheaper and less stressful.	
My Baggage sells itself as a simpler, cheaper and less stressful alternative to paying airline baggage fees by taking luggage out of the airport equation. Instead of adding bags at the check‑in desk, travellers pre‑book a door‑to‑door (or airport‑to‑airport) shipping service that collects luggage and delivers it to the destination.

Key features that make it more appealing for travellers who want to avoid airport hassle:
- Cost savings and predictable pricing: fixed, often lower rates compared with unpredictable or high airline excess-baggage and overweight fees.  
- Convenience: home or hotel pickup and delivery removes the need to lug bags through check‑in queues and baggage reclaim.  
- Time‑saving: skip long check‑in and baggage-drop lines and avoid waiting at arrival carousel.  
- Flexibility: options for different weights/sizes, special handling for sports/oversize items and long‑stay moves that airlines may restrict or charge heavily for.  
- Transparency and control: online booking, tracking updates and estimated delivery windows so travellers know where their items are.  
- Protection and support: insurance/cover levels and customer service to handle claims, customs paperwork and international logistics.  
- Wide network: partnerships with multiple couriers to offer international coverage and tailored services.

Combined, those features appeal to families, older travellers, people with oversized or excess luggage, and anyone who values time and convenience over packing to airline limits — letting them avoid airport queues, surprise fees and the stress of managing heavy bags themselves.	
The My Baggage blog supports people facing big transitions (moving home, going to university, relocating abroad) by providing practical, step‑by‑step information and resources you can use straight away. In short it helps by:

- Giving clear checklists and packing lists (e.g., essentials for halls, what to take abroad, what to leave/sell) so you don’t forget anything.
- Laying out timelines and “what to do when” plans for moving day, pre-departure tasks, shipping deadlines and when to book services.
- Explaining logistics: shipping and baggage options, how to get quotes/book, storage choices, customs/visa/documentation advice and insurance considerations.
- Offering budget and cost‑saving guidance (how to reduce costs, compare shipping vs airline baggage, student money tips).
- Delivering destination and student‑specific guides (accommodation tips, local living costs, settling‑in advice and campus survival tips).
- Providing FAQs, real customer stories and downloadable resources to make planning less stressful and more actionable.

All of that turns a large, complex move into manageable steps so users can focus on settling into university or a new home.	
They use a bundle of familiar trust signals and practical reassurances so people feel confident before booking:

- Prominent customer reviews and ratings (third‑party reviews like Trustpilot and onsite testimonials).  
- Transparent online quotes showing door‑to‑door price, delivery window and any surcharges so there are “no hidden fees.”  
- Clear explanation of how the service works (step‑by‑step booking flow, packing guidance, size/weight limits).  
- Insurance/compensation information and clear claims/refund & cancellation policies.  
- Online tracking and booking confirmation updates so customers can follow their shipment.  
- Secure payment options (SSL, major card brands/PayPal) and visible payment security cues.  
- Contactable customer support (phone/email/FAQ/live chat) and an accessible claims/help process.  
- Trust badges and partner logos (major courier partners) to signal credibility.

Together these elements reduce uncertainty and build confidence for new users before they book.	
- Door-to-door convenience: your bags are collected from your home (or other address) and delivered to your destination, so you don’t have to haul them to/through the airport.
- Time savings: skip checking baggage, long drop-off/collection queues and the extra time needed between connections.
- Less physical strain and stress: no dragging heavy or multiple suitcases, useful for families, older travellers or those with mobility issues.
- Cheaper or simpler for bulky/oversized items: sports equipment, musical instruments or extra suitcases can be less expensive and easier to ship than paying airline excess/oversize fees.
- Fewer airport hassles: avoid airline baggage restrictions, losing time re‑tagging or rechecking when changing carriers, and reduce the chance of misrouting at busy airports.
- Tracking and insurance: booked shipments typically include online tracking and liability cover for added peace of mind.
- Flexible for special trips: ideal for cruise passengers, students moving, long-term stays or tours where you want to travel light.

When shipping personal effects to the USA with My Baggage you will normally be asked to provide:

- A clear copy of your passport ID page (and visa/ESTA if applicable).  
- A detailed, itemised packing list (in English) showing each article, serial numbers for electronics where relevant, and estimated values.  
- Proof of travel/arrival (flight booking or itinerary) or proof of US residence/address.  
- Receipts for any new or high‑value items (to prove value and date of purchase).  
- Any permits/licences for restricted items (if applicable).

You’ll also be asked to sign the customs/brokerage paperwork (power of attorney/clearance authorisation) so My Baggage’s customs broker can clear the shipment. For household goods the appropriate US customs declaration (e.g. forms for unaccompanied personal effects) may also be required — My Baggage will advise which form to complete. If you’re unsure which documents apply to your shipment, contact My Baggage customer services before sending.	
V.Business es el programa/cuenta corporativa de Volaris, y por sí sola no define una franquicia estándar de equipaje: lo que puedes llevar depende de la tarifa que compres y del convenio específico que tenga tu empresa. En términos generales:

- Artículo personal (bolso pequeño, laptop): suele estar siempre incluido.  
- Equipaje de mano (cabina) y equipaje documentado: su inclusión y cantidad dependen de la tarifa (p. ej. Viva Basic normalmente sólo incluye artículo personal; tarifas superiores incluyen maleta de mano y/o maletas documentadas).  
- Algunas cuentas V.Business pueden tener beneficios adicionales (maletas incluidas o descuentos en equipaje) según el contrato corporativo.

Para confirmarlo exactamente:
1) Revisa el detalle de beneficios en el portal de tu cuenta V.Business o el contrato de tu empresa.  
2) Mira la tarifa de tu reserva (Viva Basic/Classic/Plus u otra) para ver la franquicia aplicable.  
3) Si quieres, dime la tarifa o pásame la información de la reserva y te indico concretamente qué piezas/pesos están permitidos, o te explico cómo comprobarlo paso a paso en la web de Volaris.	
My Baggage’s standard per‑item weight limit for international luggage is typically 32 kg (about 70 lb). Items heavier than that usually need to be booked as freight/pallet or oversized shipments and will incur extra charges — check your online quote or contact My Baggage support to confirm limits and pricing for your specific route.	
They’d need to adopt stricter packing and travel habits — or pay for checked baggage. Practical adjustments include:

- Downsize your bag to something that definitely meets the new, smaller limits (measure and weigh it at home).
- Cut items to essentials only: plan outfits, wear your bulkiest clothes and shoes on the plane, limit shoes to 1–2 pairs.
- Use a capsule wardrobe and versatile, quick‑dry layers so you can re-wear and launder on the road.
- Replace liquids with solid alternatives (shampoo bars, solid deodorant) and use travel‑size or refillable bottles that meet the new restrictions.
- Use compression packing cubes and roll clothing to save space, but don’t overfill beyond checked‑baggage size.
- Reduce electronics and accessories; choose multi‑purpose devices and limit chargers/cables.
- Be prepared to prepay for a checked bag or buy priority/priority boarding if you want guaranteed carry‑on space.
- Consider shipping bulky items ahead or buying low-cost replacements at your destination.
- Join a frequent‑flyer program or use cards that include baggage allowances if you travel often.
- Expect possible gate checks, extra fees, and longer waits — plan layovers and arrival times accordingly.

In short: pack lighter and smarter, switch to smaller luggage, or accept added costs and logistics of checking or shipping items.	
I don’t have enough context to answer precisely — which story or date do you mean? If you can point me to the article or when you heard it I’ll give a specific explanation.

Short version of the likely possibilities (these are the common reasons BA would sue the government):

- Financial losses from government-caused disruption: BA could challenge government failures (for instance border/immigration staffing or IT problems) that it says caused widespread delays, cancellations and large costs.  
- Policy or regulatory challenges: BA might seek a judicial review of a new government aviation policy (tax changes such as Air Passenger Duty, slot rules, noise or environmental regulations) it believes is unlawful or disproportionate.  
- Alleged unlawful state aid or unfair advantage to rivals: if the government supports competing carriers or airports in a way BA thinks breaches competition or subsidy rules, BA could sue.  
- Contractual disputes: legal action over specific contracts (airspace management, ground handling, infrastructure) awarded or changed by government bodies.

If you tell me the article or date, I’ll summarize the exact reason and the companies’ statements.	
I don’t have enough detail to give an exact price — which carrier’s “Express” service do you mean (DHL, FedEx, UPS, USPS, a luggage-specific shipper)? Also I need origin ZIP/city and destination postcode/city (and the suitcase dimensions) to get an accurate quote.

If you need a quick ballpark: for a 30 kg (≈66 lb) suitcase shipped USA → UK on a major courier’s express service expect roughly $250–$800. Typical ranges:
- DHL/FedEx/UPS International Express: about $300–$700 (depends on origin city, dimensions and surcharges)
- USPS Priority/Express Intl: sometimes cheaper (≈$200–$450) but service and speed differ
- Specialist luggage shippers or consolidators can be cheaper or similar depending on service.

Things that change the price: exact dimensions (dimensional weight), pickup/delivery ZIPs, declared value (insurance), fuel/special surcharges, and whether courier handles customs clearance (duties/VAT will be extra).

If you tell me the carrier (or let me compare major carriers), the origin and destination postcodes and the suitcase dimensions, I can look up a much more precise estimate.

A. 26.4 pounds — Air France allows a combined carry-on weight of 12 kg (≈26.4 lb) for Economy passengers.	
Because Australian authorities and carriers treat bulky/heavy consignments differently from small parcels. Once a shipment exceeds certain size/weight thresholds (commonly around 100 kg) it is classed as commercial cargo rather than a standard international parcel, and that triggers extra formalities and costs that smaller parcels usually avoid. Splitting can therefore reduce those extra charges.

What changes when you go over the threshold
- Formal import declaration: larger consignments typically require a full import declaration and supporting paperwork, which means customs-brokerage fees.  
- Freight handling and transport class: shipments >100 kg often move as air/sea freight (not courier parcel), attracting higher freight, terminal handling and documentation charges.  
- Biosecurity/quarantine inspections and storage: bigger consignments are more likely to be selected for inspection and to incur storage/demurrage fees if held.  
- Higher brokerage/clearance fees: couriers offer streamlined clearance for small parcels; freight forwarders and customs brokers charge more for commercial cargo.  

Why splitting helps
- Each smaller package may stay within the courier “parcel” category and be cleared under the courier’s streamlined process, avoiding the full import-entry procedure and sizable freight/handling/brokerage fees.  
- Smaller packages are less likely to be routed via freight terminals or be held for inspection, reducing storage/demurrage risk.

A caution
- Deliberately splitting to evade duties or avoidance of reporting can be illegal. Always declare items accurately and check Australian Border Force and the Department of Agriculture rules (or consult a customs broker) so you remain compliant and understand the true cost trade‑offs.

If the new flight costs less than your original fare, Delta issues you the difference as a travel credit (eCredit). For refundable tickets they’ll refund the difference to your original form of payment.	
Because express couriers are treated and processed as formal commercial imports and because of how customs and carriers handle valuation and clearance. Key reasons:

- Different regulatory treatment: Many countries apply stricter entry procedures and lower or no “de‑minimis” exemptions to courier/express shipments than to ordinary postal items, so duties and taxes that might be waived on a mail parcel get assessed on a courier consignment.

- Clearer documentation and valuation: Couriers submit detailed commercial invoices, HS codes and full values to customs, making it easier for authorities to assess the correct duties (instead of being overlooked or undervalued).

- Commercial classification and quantity: Shipments sent by couriers are often treated as commercial imports (B2B, resale, samples in quantity), which attract normal tariff rates rather than gift/personal‑use concessions.

- Brokerage and handling charges: Couriers pay duties on the importer’s behalf and add brokerage, disbursement and handling fees. Those are not customs duties but they increase the total amount the recipient pays and can make the shipment appear more expensive.

- Faster, more auditable clearance: Because express consignments are cleared quickly and electronically, customs audits and assessments are more likely and more accurate.

How to reduce surprises: check the destination country’s de‑minimis and postal vs courier rules, request DDP pricing (duties prepaid) from the sender, use postal services for low‑value personal items if appropriate, and ensure correct HS codes and invoices so duty is assessed properly.

Generally you’ll need about 1,500 total flight hours (the FAA ATP minimum most airlines use). However, SkyWest’s Pathway/cadet partnerships can sometimes accept pilots with fewer hours (commonly down to about 1,000 under R‑ATP or airline‑sponsored training routes). Requirements change, so check SkyWest’s careers/pathway page or contact a recruiter for the current minimum.	
Air France cabin baggage (carry-on) must fit within 55 x 35 x 25 cm (including pockets, wheels and handles). In addition you may take one personal item (handbag or laptop bag) up to about 40 x 30 x 15 cm.

Weight limits vary by fare and route (many Economy fares limit carry-on to 12 kg total; Business/La Première allowances can be higher), so check your ticket or Air France’s website for the exact limit on your booking.	
Air Canada’s checked-bag maximum is 158 cm (62 in) total (length + width + height), including wheels and handles. Bags larger than that are considered oversized and may incur fees or be refused.	
I don’t have the passage you’re referring to — can you paste the sentence or source text? If you can’t, tell me where it’s from (article title or site) and I’ll help find the two countries.	
Three. Hawaiian treats those as separate charges: a standard checked-bag charge for the suitcase, an overweight surcharge because the bag is 75 lb (over the airline’s weight limit), and an oversize/sports-equipment fee for the 68‑inch surfboard (over the maximum linear/length limit).	
Ryanair allows one free small personal bag up to 40 x 20 x 25 cm (15.7 x 7.9 x 9.8 in) — it must fit under the seat in front. This size includes handles/wheels; there’s no specified weight limit for the small bag. Check Ryanair’s website before travel in case of policy changes.	
They would need a parental authorization: a notarized/written consent from both parents or the legal guardian allowing the child to transit Mexico. A similar minor traveling before 16 November would not have been required to show that.	
They could still get seats checked or changed using Aer Lingus’ non‑web channels:

- Call the Aer Lingus contact/reservations centre and ask an agent to confirm or reassign your seat (have your booking reference/flight number and passenger names ready).  
- Use the Aer Lingus mobile app or the airline’s “Manage booking” service if those remain operational — agents can often complete changes there even when the seat‑selection page is down.  
- At the airport: use a self‑service check‑in kiosk or go to the Aer Lingus check‑in desk to view and change seats (or pay any applicable seat fees) when you check in.  
- At the gate: speak to the gate agent on the day of travel to request a seat change or confirmation.  
- If available, contact Aer Lingus via live chat or their social‑media channels for guidance or to be routed to the correct phone team.

Note: seat changes are subject to availability and any applicable charges, so arrive early and have your PNR and ID to speed the process.	
Use the airline’s online and web-based channels — not the phone line. Specifically:

- Go to Loganair’s website and open the Manage Booking (or My Bookings) page. Enter your booking reference and surname, select the reservation and choose the “change” option. Pick new flights, accept any fare difference/fees and pay online; you’ll receive an updated confirmation by email.

- If the change you need cannot be completed via Manage Booking, contact Loganair by the web LiveChat or by the email/web contact form given in the notice. Provide your booking reference, the change required and passenger details; LiveChat can usually make the change straight away, email/web form for non‑urgent requests.

Also have your booking reference, passenger names and payment details ready, and keep copies/screenshots of any confirmations.	
Short answer: you would have to pay American’s first-checked-bag fee instead of getting it free. That means an immediate out‑of‑pocket increase roughly in the $60–$100 one‑way range (≈ £45–£80), depending on how AA prices that route and whether you buy the allowance in advance or at the airport. If it’s a return trip, double that.

Details / caveats:
- Airlines often charge less if you pay online at booking (lower end of the range) and more at the airport (higher end).
- Exact amount depends on AA’s published fee for the London–New York route, the currency conversion, and whether you have status or a card benefit that waives the fee.
- Overweight/oversize charges would add more if the bag is heavy.	
Short answer: It depends on how many pieces your fare allows. Under a piece system the airline cares about the number of bags and each bag’s maximum weight, not the total kilos.

What changes for your case (two light bags totaling 25 kg):
- If your Economy fare on the new piece-route permits two pieces (and each piece must not exceed the per‑piece limit, typically 23 kg on many carriers), you would be fine — two bags of ~12–13 kg each would be within the allowance.
- If your fare only includes one piece (common on many discounted fares), you would be charged an “extra piece” fee for the second bag even though the combined weight is only 25 kg. That fee is usually higher than a simple overweight fee would have been under the weight system.

Practical steps:
1. Check the new piece-allowance on your ticket (how many pieces your fare includes and the per-piece weight limit).  
2. Weigh each bag — if one bag can be made ≤ the per-piece limit and you only have a one-piece allowance, consolidate to avoid an extra-piece charge.  
3. If you can’t consolidate, prepay an extra piece or upgrade your fare (usually cheaper to prepay than to pay airport excess fees).

Bottom line: two light bags totaling 25 kg will be fine if your fare allows two pieces; otherwise you’ll face an extra-piece charge despite the low total weight.
