Because My Baggage’s price is calculated from both size and weight, they need truthful bike measurements so the correct charge is applied. Quotes use the greater of actual weight or volumetric weight (length × width × height in cm ÷ 5000) and there is a 30 kg (66 lb) baseline—weights above this trigger automatic excess‑weight surcharges. Any single dimension over 120 cm may also incur an oversize fee (up to £80) because oversized items need special handling. Accurate external measurements (including wheels, handles, etc.) ensure the online quote matches carrier limits and avoid unexpected surcharges or handling problems.

For Basic fares bought on or after January 3, 2025, passengers on Canada–U.S. routes (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico) may only bring one (1) personal item — no carry‑on bag. Bringing a carry‑on or checked bag requires paying the standard baggage fees.	
- More choices for baggage, booking and check‑in (online, city, home check‑in — e.g., Abu Dhabi, Sharjah — plus add‑ons: extra baggage, seats, meals, insurance, airport services) increases passenger convenience and flexibility and lets travelers tailor trips to needs.
- Pre‑purchase options (via website/app/booking channels) can reduce airport wait times and typically avoid higher airport fees noted in the small print.
- Multiple booking channels, the Air Arabia app and AirRewards access improve accessibility and personalization across hubs and countries (UAE, Morocco, Egypt, KSA, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, etc.).
- Country‑specific terminals, fare types and local rules mean allowances, charges and available services can vary by origin — passengers must check fare types, modification/cancellation charges and local airport procedures to avoid surprises.
- Overall effect: greater convenience and control for passengers who plan ahead; potential for extra cost or confusion for those who don’t verify country‑specific allowances and airport fees.	
Short answer: exceeding weight and/or volume increases your final cost through multiple, cumulative charges and possible penalties — and can cause delays or return.

Key effects (keywords from the policy):
- Admin fee: a £20 admin charge for shipments that exceed the booked service limits (3.1).  
- Oversize flat fees: service-dependent oversize fees (commonly £30–£60; e.g. £60+VAT for >117 cm on many European services; some routes/conditions can incur £120 or other published oversize fees).  
- Extra per-piece penalties: if you exceed a service’s maximum limits you may be liable for an additional charge (route-dependent) of up to £200 per piece.  
- Excess weight/volume rates: excess volume or weight can be billed at 150% of the per‑kg rate paid for the original shipment (Paragraph 4.5).  
- Charging bands: if you exceed an upper weight band you are charged in extra 5 kg bands; if volume exceeds an upper band you are charged in additional 5 kg / 25,000 cm³ bands (rates vary by route).  
- Other surcharges: items over specific breakpoints (e.g. >31 kg, longest dimension thresholds, length+girth limits) may trigger additional fixed fees (£20–40, £60+VAT, etc.).  
- Consequences: overweight/oversized items may be delayed, refused, returned (return charges apply), or require collection from a depot. All additional charges will be passed to the customer (may be charged to your card and passed on within 90 days).

Net effect: your original quote will increase by admin + oversize flat fees + per‑kg/volume surcharges (often at premium rates), potentially up to the route’s maximum penalty (up to £200/piece), plus any return or handling costs.	
Key context: Send My Bag charges oversize handling fees because items over ~117 cm "cannot move through the network on standard conveyor belts and cost considerably more to handle" and "Send My Bag makes no profit on these fees and charges at cost."

Likely impacts if those oversize fees were removed:
- Cost recovery: the additional handling costs for oversized pieces would no longer be recovered via the fee, so those costs would have to be absorbed by the company or shifted into higher baseline prices or other surcharges.
- Network efficiency: more items that cannot use standard conveyor belts would increase manual handling, create bottlenecks at sorting/collection points and slow throughput, reducing overall operational efficiency.
- Operational changes: removal of the fee would likely force changes to routing/handling (more palletisation, special vehicles or manual processes, extra labour) to cope with oversized items.
- Service risk and limits: higher volumes of oversized items could increase delays, damage/loss risk and agent charges; the company might respond by tightening size/weight limits or applying other penalties (e.g., tailored quotes, maximum-dimension rules).
- Margin and pricing strategy: to remain viable the business would need to raise other prices, introduce alternative surcharges, or restrict services for oversized shipments.	
- Basic passengers would again be allowed a full carry-on plus one personal item on Canada–US routes (restoring the prior allowance).
- More travellers would bring carry-on suitcases instead of only a personal item.
- Likely fewer passengers would pay to check bags (reducing checked‑bag purchases under the “standard baggage fare rules”).
- More competition for overhead bin space and earlier boarding/gate congestion as passengers try to secure room for carry‑ons.
- No change to the announced complimentary check‑in seat assignment for Basic customers (effective Jan 21, 2025).	
Key points from the provided context a traveller would weigh:

- Cost comparison: British Airways charges an overweight/heavy-bag fee of £65 GBP / €75 EUR / $100 USD / $100 CAD per bag per journey. Adding extra checked bags with BA online ranges roughly £35–£140 (route-dependent) but is more expensive at the airport (£75–£165).  
- Weight limits: BA normally limits checked bags to 23kg (some routes/tickets allow up to 32kg); bags over 32kg will not be accepted. Avios cannot pay overweight/oversize fees.  
- Send My Bag offer: Send My Bag / My Baggage lets you ship up to ~30 kg (66 lb) per suitcase at “fantastic low rates,” with online booking, door collection/delivery, tracking and compensation options.  
- Convenience and risk: Paying BA overweight or airport fees can be costly and unpredictable at check-in; booking extra bags online with BA is cheaper than airport fees. Using Send My Bag can be cheaper than BA overweight/extra-bag airport charges, avoids the baggage carousel, and avoids BA’s >32kg refusal risk.

Net effect on decision: if the BA overweight or late/airport extra-bag fees approach or exceed Send My Bag’s shipping rate for a 30 kg suitcase, or if you risk exceeding BA’s 32 kg limit or want door-to-door convenience and tracking, a traveller may choose Send My Bag. If adding a standard extra bag online with BA is clearly cheaper and within BA weight limits, paying BA for an extra checked bag may be preferable.	
My Baggage positions itself as a cost‑and‑stress saving alternative to airline baggage by letting travellers ship luggage ahead (so they “skip the baggage carousel”), avoid airline excess baggage fees, and take a larger allowance per item (30 kg / 66 lb, with options to pay for heavier bags).

Combination of features that reduce airport hassle:
- Door‑to‑door collections and deliveries (they collect from you and deliver to destination)  
- Ship‑ahead model so you travel light and avoid reclaim queues and lost‑baggage risk  
- Generous 30 kg / 66 lb allowance per suitcase (extra weight options available)  
- Full online tracking, SMS/email notifications and “My Orders” tracking  
- FREE & enhanced compensation cover options and simplified customs guidance  
- Dedicated customer support (phone, email, live chat), flexible booking and easy online booking/label printing  
- Worldwide service (200+ countries) and cost savings (up to ~80% vs going direct to couriers)

These combined lower cost, save time, reduce risk and remove the need to haul luggage through airports.	
By publishing practical resources and guides: the site/blog offers Moving Guides (including destination-specific guides for London, New York and California), a Packaging Guide (what to pack, recommended suitcases/boxes and internal padding), customs guidance, step‑by‑step booking/collection instructions, student‑shipping tips (storage alternatives, timelines) and cost‑saving/quote information — plus access to customer support — to make relocating or starting university seamless and stress‑free.	
They build trust by highlighting independent customer social proof (Trustpilot/20k+ reviews, 150k++ customers and many video reviews), offering full online tracking with SMS/email notifications, providing FREE (and optional enhanced) compensation cover (e.g. £100 free cover per shipment), giving clear online quotes/booking and customs guidance, partnering with leading couriers for door‑to‑door service and fast transit, and supplying dedicated customer support by phone, email and live chat.

- Check your airline’s published carry‑on size/weight before booking or packing.  
- Swap to a smaller, lighter bag that definitely fits under-seat or in the overhead (measure with handles retracted).  
- Weigh at home (luggage or bathroom scale) and aim to be ~1.3 kg under the airline limit.  
- Pare down to essentials only (clothes, documents, meds, laptop/personal item) so you meet tighter limits.  
- Be prepared to gate‑check larger items (or pay fees) — low‑cost carriers may force non‑priority bags into the hold.  
- Consider paying for priority/extra allowance or using a luggage send‑ahead service if you can’t travel light.	
Because of the UK government’s new 14-day quarantine/self‑isolation rule for arrivals — introduced without consulting airlines — which BA (and CEO Willie Walsh) calls “irrational” and “disproportionate” and says will severely damage tourism and BA’s finances (job cuts, rapid cash burn), so it’s considering legal action.

Because Australian customs typically treats shipments over 100 kg as having a declared value above A$1,000 — and any consignment with a declared value over A$1,000 may attract a c. A$100 formal clearance fee (and possible duties). Splitting into multiple smaller orders keeps each consignment below the 100 kg / A$1,000 threshold so you can avoid the A$100 formal clearance charge (customs won’t split a single consignment for duty calculations, so separate orders are required).	
Children between the ages of two weeks and twelve years old.	
A travel credit for the fare difference (typically valid up to one year from the original ticket purchase date).	
Because commercial couriers typically treat consignments as commercial shipments—using commercial invoices (and not specialist personal‑effects or free‑entry declaration forms) and offering limited customs guidance—customs will often classify them as commercial goods, triggering higher duties and making it hard to re‑claim personal‑effects status after processing.

Short answer: it could force you to pay or repack — it depends on your fare.

Why: under the weight concept your two light bags totaling 25 kg would be fine (Economy commonly allows ~30 kg). If Emirates switched to the piece concept, Economy free allowance is by pieces:
- Economy Special / Saver: 1 piece up to 23 kg — two bags totaling 25 kg would exceed the free allowance → you’d need to pay for an extra piece or repack into one bag ≤23 kg.
- Economy Flex / Flex Plus: 2 pieces up to 23 kg each — your two light bags (total 25 kg, and assuming each bag ≤23 kg) would be allowed.

Also note piece limits: max dimensions per piece 150 cm and single-bag weight limits (per context) up to 32 kg for higher classes.
