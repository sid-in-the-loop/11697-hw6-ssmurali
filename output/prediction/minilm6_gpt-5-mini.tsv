My Baggage is suitable for people moving abroad because it offers: 
- Door-to-door collections and deliveries (collects from your doorstep, delivers to destination). 
- International coverage (200+ countries, 1,000+ routes) and moving guides for popular destinations. 
- Services for personal effects (suitcases, boxes, bikes, sports equipment, home furnishings). 
- Fast air‑freight options (faster than sea freight) and cheaper rates than booking couriers or paying excess airline baggage fees. 
- Full online tracking plus SMS/email notifications. 
- Customs guidance, free/enhanced compensation cover, and customer support (phone, email, live chat).	
Because it avoids airline excess-baggage pain points by offering: higher per-item allowance (up to 66 lb, with paid options for heavier items); lower/transparent rates vs “extortionate” airline fees; door-to-door collection and delivery; full online tracking; fast transit to 200+ countries (delivery 1–5 days); and dedicated customer support — reducing waiting at baggage reclaim and the risk of lost luggage.	
Travelpro’s Terms of Use use several clear legal tools to reduce the company’s exposure while still permitting customer use of the site:

- Broad disclaimer: the Sites are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” with no express or implied warranties (including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement).  
- Limitation of liability: Travelpro (and affiliates, employees, directors, officers, agents, suppliers) disclaims liability for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages “to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.”  
- Indemnification: users must defend, indemnify, and hold Travelpro and related parties harmless for claims arising from users’ breaches or activities; users may not settle claims affecting Travelpro without prior written approval.  
- Mandatory dispute terms: the Agreement includes a mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver (users’ continued use constitutes agreement).  
- Operational protections: Travelpro may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Sites or services and may correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions without liability.  
- Content and third‑party limits: Travelpro owns/licences Site content, can monitor/edit/remove User Content, assumes no liability for user‑posted content, and disclaims responsibility for linked third‑party sites.  
- User obligations: users are responsible for account confidentiality, lawful use, and compliance with content and conduct rules (violations can lead to suspension/termination).

These provisions collectively allow customers to access and use the website while shifting risk to users and narrowing Travelpro’s legal exposure.	
Because My Baggage charges are calculated from weight and size, they require accurate measurements so customers are quoted the correct fee at booking. The price is based on the greater of actual weight or volumetric weight ((L×W×H in cm) ÷ 5000); shipments must not exceed 30 kg or automatic excess‑weight surcharges apply. Any single dimension over 120 cm may trigger an oversize fee (up to £80 or equivalent), and some routes have extra restrictions—so accurate dimensions prevent unexpected surcharges and routing issues.	
Two separate airlines.	
INR 1,300 per kg (USD 16 per kg).	
Same‑day change fee: starting at $60 for U.S., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands flights.	
For Canada–U.S. routes, Basic (Economy) fares purchased on or after Jan 3, 2025 will no longer include a carry‑on bag. Passengers may bring only one (1) personal article (this applies within Canada and to/from the U.S., including Hawaii and Puerto Rico). Standard baggage fare rules apply. (Note: from Jan 21, 2025 the Basic fare will still include complimentary seat assignment at check‑in for customers who didn’t pre‑pay for a seat.)	
- Convenience & flexibility: multiple booking channels and add‑ons (Add Baggage, Add Seats, Add Meals, Add Insurance, Add Airport Services) let passengers tailor their trip and avoid airport surprises.  
- Faster, localised processing: online, city, and home check‑in (examples: Home Check‑in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah) reduce queueing and improve door‑to‑gate experience for travellers in those cities.  
- Route‑ and hub‑specific service: having hubs across UAE, Morocco, Egypt, KSA, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and many Asian destinations means services can be adapted to country/route needs and connections.  
- Cost transparency and planning: the ability to add baggage and extras at booking helps passengers estimate total price and influence purchase decisions (ancillary fees can materially affect fare).  
- Potential complexity: variation by fare type, route, and local rules means passengers must check country‑specific baggage and check‑in policies to avoid confusion or unexpected fees.	
- Price will be re‑calculated using the larger of actual weight or volumetric weight (volumetric = L×W×H in cm ÷ 5000).  
- An administrative fee (from £20) is charged for exceeding booked service limits (clause 3.1).  
- Overweight/oversize surcharges vary by service/route: examples in the policy include £20–40 for items over ~31 kg, £30–60 for dimensions >117 cm (and for some second dimensions), and a £120 fee on some services for very long length+girth.  
- Some carriers/services have lower hard limits (e.g., 30 kg on some UK services/DHL/UPS/FedEx; 45 kg on some routes; 70 kg on most international services); exceeding absolute maximums can trigger an additional charge of up to £200 per piece plus any extra weight billed at the per‑kilo rate for the route.  
- Extra/courier‑imposed rates (or website rates) apply and Send My Bag charges at cost.  
- Consequences may include delays, refusal of collection, return to sender and return charges.	
Key facts from the context: oversize fees exist because items over ~117 cm "cannot move through the network on standard conveyor belts and cost considerably more to handle," and Send My Bag "makes no profit on these fees and charges at cost."

Likely effects if those fees were removed
- Operational efficiency: more items would require manual handling, creating bottlenecks, slower processing and higher handling time per piece because conveyors and standard processes cannot accommodate >117 cm pieces.
- Cost structure: the at‑cost oversize handling expense would be absorbed by Send My Bag, raising per‑shipment operating costs and reducing margins unless offset elsewhere.
- Pricing/route impacts: to compensate Send My Bag would need to raise base prices, add other surcharges, limit eligible routes/services, or invest in equipment/upgrades to the network.
- Customer experience/claims: increased manual handling and route variability could lead to more delays and reliance on tailored quotes for accurate pricing (fees vary by route), and under existing terms customers could still face later additional charges if size/weight rules are breached.

Keywords: cannot move through standard conveyor belts, cost considerably more to handle, charges at cost, manual handling, bottlenecks, higher operating costs, reduced margins, raise base prices or add surcharges, tailored quote, delays.	
- More passengers would carry a single full carry-on instead of checking bags — GAO and Air Canada data show baggage-fee changes shift behavior toward carry-ons to avoid checked-bag fees.  
- Fewer paid checked-baggage purchases and lower ancillary baggage revenue (passengers would be less likely to pay to check).  
- More travellers might opt for the Basic fare (or stop upgrading) because the fare would again include a carry-on, altering fare-choice behavior.  
- Less time/effort spent hunting for total trip cost and fewer surprises from unexpected baggage charges, since a carry-on allowance would be included in the fare decision (baggage fees are “critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions” per the Department’s analysis).	
Key facts from the context
- British Airways heavy/overweight fee: £65 GBP, €75 EUR, $100 USD or $100 CAD per bag per journey. Bags heavier than 32 kg will not be accepted.  
- Checked-bag online prices vary widely (rough guide: £20–£120 per bag depending on route/ticket/time); airport prices are higher (rough guide: £40–£140). Booking baggage before travel saves money.  
- Oversize items up to 190 x 75 x 65 cm can sometimes be accepted but may need special handling and earlier check‑in. Avios cannot pay overweight/oversize fees.  
- Send My Bag / My Baggage offers a courier option (advertised as 66 lb ≈ 30 kg per item) and pitches lower, more convenient rates than airline excess fees.

How that influences the decision
- Cost: If you would trigger BA’s overweight charge (£65 / $100 etc.) for one or more bags, a Send My Bag quote may be cheaper than paying repeated overweight or last‑minute airport charges. Conversely, if adding a standard extra checked bag online (booked in advance) falls within the lower online price range, that can be cost‑effective.  
- Weight limit risk: BA will refuse bags >32 kg. If your items exceed that, you must either split into additional checked bags (and pay fees) or use a courier like Send My Bag. Note Send My Bag’s quoted 66 lb (~30 kg) per item is close to BA’s limit.  
- Convenience and unpredictability: Airport/airport‑paid fees are higher and some airports limit accepted payment methods; Send My Bag avoids airport hassle and potential surprise charges. Oversize/exceptional items that need special handling may also be easier with a courier.  
- Practical rule: For modest extra weight where online extra‑bag fees are low, add a checked bag in advance. For multiple heavy items, oversized items, or when avoiding potential airport/overweight fees and handling hassles, Send My Bag can be the better option.	
My Baggage positions itself as a cost‑effective, convenient alternative to airline baggage — ship your bags ahead and avoid excess airline fees, long queues and the baggage carousel.

Key features (combination that makes it appealing):
- Door‑to‑door collection and delivery (no airport drop‑off/collection).  
- Generous allowance: 30 kg / 66 lbs per suitcase.

- Door-to-door collection and delivery plus full online tracking — no hauling bags through trains, taxis or airports.  
- Travel light: skip check‑in queues and baggage reclaim, reduce risk of delayed or missing hold luggage.

My Baggage allows up to 30 kg (66 lbs) per item when shipping luggage to Australia.	
- Pack lighter and lean on space-saving gear (packing cubes, tech pouch); consider a travel backpack with a laptop compartment so everything fits one bag.  
- Weigh bags at home and keep them ~1.3 kg under the airline limit because home scales and airport scales can differ.  
- Consolidate items: if airlines ban a second personal item, combine handbag/laptop into your single carry-on or keep essentials on your person (passport, wallet).  
- Be prepared for gate-checking: non‑Priority passengers may have larger bags sent to the hold at the gate.  
- Buy Priority Boarding or pay to bring a larger cabin bag when available.  
- If you have too much, consider shipping excess luggage (e.g., My Baggage) rather than paying airline oversize/overweight fees.	
Because the UK’s new 14‑day quarantine/self‑isolation rules for arrivals — which BA says were introduced without consulting airlines — are viewed by British Airways (and CEO Willie Walsh) as “irrational” and “disproportionate” and likely to devastate air travel and tourism, worsening BA’s severe cash burn and job cuts.

Because Australian customs typically treats shipments over 100 kg as having a declared customs value over $1,000 AUD. A declared value above $1,000 AUD (or a single large consignment) can trigger an approx. $100 AUD formal clearance fee and extra customs scrutiny. Splitting the consignment into multiple smaller orders keeps each under the 100 kg / $1,000 AUD threshold and can avoid that $100 formal clearance charge.	
Children between the ages of two weeks and twelve years old.	
Delta provides a travel credit for the fare difference (typically valid up to one year).	
Because commercial couriers are set up for commercial goods and typically use simple commercial invoices (not personal‑effects clearance or free‑entry declaration forms). Without the correct personal‑effects paperwork and guidance, customs can classify the shipment as commercial and apply duties — and once cleared as commercial it’s hard to reclassify.

One fee. The 75 lb bag incurs the excess-weight charge for 71–100 lbs ($200 USD for Hawaii→Japan for travel on/after 1/2/26). The surfboard (a listed sporting item) is oversized (68 in) but oversized fees are waived for accepted sporting equipment; it would only be charged if it also exceeded the applicable weight limit.

Use the Aer Lingus support channels shown on the site:

- Contact Customer Care / the Carrier’s Contact Centre to request or change a seat (agents can verify/assign seats).  
- Use the app or the check‑in options (online or automated check‑in) — automated check‑in may offer seat choices at the end of the process if available.  
- At the airport: ask at the check‑in desk, bag‑drop or boarding gate (staff can assign or reassign seats).  
- If you need disability or special seating, use the Special Assistance / Request special assistance channel.  

Note: do not input personal booking/payment details into public search fields.	
Use Loganair’s self‑serve channels: go to the website’s "Manage My Booking" (or the Loganair app) to make the change online; if you can’t, submit a request via the online contact form ("Contact us via our online form" — select "Want to change a booking"); as a last alternative for same‑day/airport issues you can handle changes at the airport check‑in/desk.	
They would incur a $100 charge for that first checked bag (the transatlantic "first additional piece" fee). So a one-way London→New York trip would cost $100 more; a round-trip would add $200.	
You would move from a weight-based rule (total 25 kg allowed across two bags) to a piece-based rule that limits number and per-bag weight. Under Emirates’ piece concept for Economy:
- Economy Special/Saver: 1 piece up to 23 kg free — your two bags (total 25 kg) would not meet this (you have two pieces and one exceeds the 23 kg allowance if counted separately).
- Economy Flex/Flex Plus: allowed 2 pieces up to 23 kg each — no problem if your two bags are ≤23 kg each.

So, unless you hold a Flex/Flex Plus fare, you’d need to either consolidate to a single bag ≤23 kg or pay for an extra piece (per-piece excess fee ≈ $200 full price; discounted online options may apply).
