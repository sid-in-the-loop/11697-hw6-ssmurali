They fly to over 183 destinations and are one of only a few airlines to fly to all 6 inhabited continents. On this page, you can find all the information you will need about British Airways baggage allowance and fees. Explore our luggage storage options. British Airways Cabin Baggage With British Airways, passengers are allowed one piece of hand luggage and one personal item as carry-on baggage. The maximum size for hand luggage is 56 x 45 x 23cm and it must weigh no more than 23kg. The small item must be no larger than 40 x 30 x 15cm. If your hand luggage is larger than this, it will be checked into the hold, and you will be charged for checked luggage.

The cost of travelling with checked baggage will depend on your route. Bags should not be heavier than 23kg or 32kg (this will be determined by your route/ticket type). The maximum size is 90 x 75 x 43cm – anything larger than this will be classed as excess baggage.

If your bag is heavier than 32kg it will be shipped as cargo. Please contact the airline directly for more information about this. British Airways Sports Equipment The British Airways policy for sports equipment is very straightforward. If your equipment is within the checked luggage size and weight allowances then you can take it as normal – you may need to book extra bags for this. If they are heavier or larger, then you can arrange to have them shipped as cargo. It is recommended to contact British Airways at least 48 hours before your flight. British Airways Musical Instruments As with sports equipment, as long as your instrument is within the British Airways size and weight allowances, you can travel with them as carry-on or checked luggage. If your instrument is larger than hand luggage but you do not wish for it to go in the hold, you may like to reserve a seat for it. You cannot book these seats online, so make sure to contact the airline at least 24 hours before you fly to check availability. Pro tip: When travelling with an instrument, make sure you pack it in a sturdy flight case to prevent it being damaged. Contact British Airways To get help with baggage enquiries, you can contact British Airways directly on 0344 493 0787 6am – 11pm daily.
