Your free baggage allowance is based on either the total amount of weight or on how many pieces of luggage you have. This is called the weight or piece concept.The weight concept applies to most routes. The piece concept applies only on flights to and from the Americas and Africa. Your allowance depends on where you’re traveling, your fare, and your travel class.There are general rules and guidelines for baggage allowance on Emirates flights. To check the baggage rules specific to your journey, and how much extra baggage will cost, visit Manage Your Booking. If you’re an Emirates Skywards Platinum, Gold, or Silver member, you could also enjoy extra baggage allowance on routes that use the weight concept. When traveling on piece concept routes on Emirates flights only, Emirates Skywards Platinum and Gold members are eligible for 1 additional piece of checked baggage at 23 kg per piece in Economy Class and 32 kg per piece in Business Class and First Class over the ticketed limit.Weight ConceptYour allowance is based on the total weight of all your baggage.You can check in as many bags as you like up to the weight allowance for your travel class.

These airlines baggage allowances may be different from Emirates. You can read the interline partner baggage allowances for information on allowances and charges for carry-on baggage and checked baggage.Checking more than 15 bagsFor operational and safety reasons, if you are checking more than 15 pieces of baggage, we may not be able to transport all of your extra baggage on the same flight as you.If that happens:We’ll carry your extra baggage on the next available flight and deliver your bags to you within five days.Our excess baggage terms and conditions apply.The Montreal Convention 1999 or the Warsaw Convention 1929 (as amended) will apply to your extra baggage as though it had been carried on the same flight as you. Your baggage will only be considered delayed under these conventions if it does not arrive within five days after your flight.
