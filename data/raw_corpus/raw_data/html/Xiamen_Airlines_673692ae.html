If the musical instruments exceed the above-mentioned regulations and are to be brought into the cabin, they should be handled in accordance with the regulations for Seated baggage.③All musical instruments brought into the cabin should be under the care of the passenger. Musical instrument must be securely placed in a shock-proof and pressure-resistant case so that it can be stored side-upright if necessary.2、As Checked Baggage①Large musical instruments (such as guitars or cellos, etc.) exceeding the above limits may be carried as checked baggage, with their weight and number of pieces included in the free baggage allowance, excess baggage will be charged.②Musical Instruments to be carried as checked-in baggage shall meet Xiamen Airlines requirements on volume and weight of checked baggage and must be securely placed in shock-proof and pressure-resistant relevant instrument cases. Xiamen Airlines shall be liable for carriage according to general checked baggage liability limit. Xiamen Airlines may refuse to carry goods that cannot be packed as required.3、As Seated Baggage①Passengers can purchase a seat for a musical instrument that needs to be brought into the cabin, name Seated Baggage.②Seated Baggage can be placed on the cabin seat or on the floor in front of the seat. A single cabin seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 40*45*100 cm, and the floor in front of the seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 25*45*140 cm, and the baggage weight may not be more than 72 kg.③Passengers should purchase seats for the musical instrument according to the actual number of seats they need. One piece of seated baggage can occupy no more than 3 seats, and the maximum measurement of the seated instrument should not be more than 40×60×140 cm.FAQQ1: Are small musical instruments included into unchecked baggage?A: Small musical instrument (including the case) with a measurement of no more than 20*40*55 cm can be included into unchecked baggage and included into other carry-on items, as long as its total weight meets relevant provisions under General Conditions for Passenger and Baggage International/Domestic Carriage of Xiamen Airlines.Therefore, if the instrument is small enough to fit in your carry-on bag and does not exceed the requirements for unchecked baggage (e.g. flute, ukulele, etc.), it will not affect your other carry-on items. Other common musical instruments (such as violins, trombones, etc.) exceeding 20*40*55 cm specification are not applicable to terms and conditions of unchecked baggage.Q2: (a measurement of more than 20*40*55 cm, and less than 25*35*95 cm) If the instrument is 25*45*55 cm, with its width exceeding the 35 limit, how will this be classified?A: 25*35* 95 cm is the maximum length that each side can accommodate. Any side exceeding the maximum length shall be excluded from this range and need to be carried as checked-in baggage. Q3: How do I know how many seats I need to buy for my Seated Baggage?A: Please refer to the images below for a better understanding of the specific placement standards and positions of musical instruments of different sizes.As shown in Image 1, a single cabin seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 40*45*100 cm, and the floor in front of the seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 25*45*140 cm. If any side of the baggage is over the above limit, more seats should be purchased.Case 1: For a violin (including its case) with 18*34*80 cm measurement and a volume within a single seat accommodating range, one seat is enough for the Seated Baggage (Image 2).Case 2: For a cello (including its case) with a measurement of 24*50*134 cm can only be placed on the floor in front of the seat because its longest side is 100 cm larger than the limit. However, its volume exceeds the accommodated baggage volume in front of the seat (25*45*140 cm), so two seats need to be purchased (Image 3).Note: For baggage that needs to be placed on the floor in front of the seat, the limits for the shortest and longest sides of the seat remain unchanged as seat interval and seat height are fixed. When the shortest side exceeds 25 cm, the baggage will not be able to be placed on the cabin floor, and when the longest side exceeds 140 cm, the baggage will not be allowed to enter the cabin as Seated Baggage.The maximum measurement of Seated Baggage in the cabin is 40*60*140 cm, which should occupy three seats.（3）Precision instrumentsPrecision instruments refer to high-precision, high-sensitivity equipment and devices used for precise measurement, experimentation, detection, analysis, etc., and should usually be transported as cargo. If they are to be transported as checked baggage, they must be approved by the ground handling agent of Xiamen Airlines. The items should be packed in the original packaging or packaging approved by Xiamen Airlines, should not be included in the free baggage allowance, and should be charged as excess baggage. For such baggage, Xiamen Airlines should be liable for carriage in accordance with the general liability limit for checked baggage. IV. Irregular Carriage of Baggage （1）General Provisions1) In the event of any delay, loss, damage or destruction of baggage carriage, the passenger should complete the baggage incident record and go through relevant procedures of Xiamen Airlines or its authorized ground handling agent at the place of the incident;2) If the passenger's checked baggage fails to arrive with the passenger due to any Xiamen Airlines reasons, and fails to be delivered to the passenger on the same day, resulting in inconvenience to passenger's journey life, the passenger can be compensated for temporary daily necessities at the following standard:Passenger classEconomy classBusiness class/Egret PlatinumFirst class/Egret DiamondCompensation for temporary daily necessitiesDomesticRMB 200RMB 300RMB 500InternationalRMB 300 or equivalent foreign currencyRMB 400 or equivalent foreign currencyRMB 500 or equivalent foreign currency（2） Compensation of Baggage1.

In the event of damage, destruction, or loss of checked luggage on Xiamen Airlines flights, Xiamen Airlines will compensate or cover repair costs within the luggage compensation limit according to the value of the lost luggage:(1) The compensation liability limit for domestic flights is RMB 100 per kilogram. If the value of the luggage is less than RMB 100 per kilogram, the compensation shall be made according to the actual value. In case of damage to the luggage box, the compensation limit shall be calculated according to the weight of the luggage box itself.(2) For international and regional flights that meet the conditions of the Warsaw Convention, the compensation limit is 250 francs per kilogram; for those that meet the conditions of the Montreal Convention, the compensation limit for checked luggage is 1519 Special Drawing Rights per passenger. Passengers bear the burden of proof for the actual value of the loss, but not exceeding the compensation limit applicable under the international convention.3. The weight used to determine Xiamen Airlines' compensation liability limit for the destruction, loss, damage, or delay of checked luggage or any items in the luggage shall only be the actual weight of the damaged luggage or items; if the weight of the damaged luggage or items cannot be determined, the damaged luggage of each passenger can only be calculated based on the free luggage allowance enjoyed by the passenger.4. Important documents and materials, securities, cash, bills, jewelry, precious metals and their products, antiques, calligraphy and painting samples, or other valuable items, fragile or perishable items, prescription medications that need to be taken regularly, medical certificates, travel documents, and other items that require personal care cannot be checked in as luggage or placed inside checked luggage. For the destruction, loss, or damage of the aforementioned items placed within checked luggage, Xiamen Airlines will only assume liability for compensation as regular checked luggage.5. When handling luggage loss compensation, the compensation for temporary living supplies that has been paid shall be deducted from the compensation amount, and the excess luggage fees charged for the compensated luggage shall be refunded.6. For domestic segments that constitute international transportation, luggage compensation shall be handled according to the applicable international transportation luggage compensation regulations.7.

Passengers can reclaim their luggage and return the full compensation, but the temporary living supplies compensation will not be refunded. If it is found that the passenger has obvious fraudulent behavior, Xiamen Airlines has the right to recover the full compensation.8.
