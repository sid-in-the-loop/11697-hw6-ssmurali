Home / Stylish, Durable Travelpro® Carry-On Luggage The Benefit of Carry-On LuggageCarry-on luggage size provides travelers with freedom and mobility. When you pack everything you need into carry-on luggage, you can avoid crowded baggage carousels and travel straight to your destination when you disembark. With no checked luggage to slow you down, you can easily navigate airports, train stations, and hotel lobbies.The Travelpro® Carry-On Luggage AdvantageTravelpro® carry-on luggage offers plenty of advantages whether you want to travel light with a garment bag or pair carry-on luggage with checked bags. Every Travelpro® Carry-on Rollaboard® and Spinner rolls effortlessly on ultra-strong wheels led by an adjustable extension handle with a comfortable grip.Travelpro® carry-on offers roomy interiors and zippered compartments to make packing easier. Adding Travelpro® packing cubes and toiletry bags helps you organize and protect your belongings while maximizing the space inside your carry-on. What Size Is Allowed for Carry-On Luggage? Most major US airlines limit carry-on luggage to bags that are 22 inches long, 14 inches wide, and 9 inches high. These three measurements should total no more than 45 linear inches, including the handles and wheels. All Travelpro® carry-on luggage is sizer-bin tested to meet this size allowance. Hard vs Soft Luggage: Which Is Better? Whether hardshell or softshell carry-ons are the best carry-on luggage depends on what you’re looking for in a carry-on bag. Hardshell carry-on offers added protection for case contents. Softshell carry-on luggage, in contrast, has enough flexibility for when you need to pack your luggage to capacity. What Does TSA Allow in a Carry-On? The TSA allows you to pack a wide range of items in a carry-on, including some lithium batteries, medication, and quart-sized clear bags of liquids, pastes, gels, and creams, as long as each item is contained in its own 3.4-ounce travel container. Certain items, including firearms, knives, fireworks, and similar items, are forbidden. Check out What’s Allowed in a Carry-On Bag for more information on TSA carry-on regulations. Do I Need a Carry On or Checked Luggage? If you’ll be home in two or three days, you can probably pack everything you need into carry-on luggage. If you’re planning a longer trip or transporting gifts, business, or sporting equipment, you’re more likely to need a checked bag or a checked bag/carry-on combo. Understanding the Pros and Cons of Carry-Ons vs. Checked Bags helps you choose the right luggage for your journey.
