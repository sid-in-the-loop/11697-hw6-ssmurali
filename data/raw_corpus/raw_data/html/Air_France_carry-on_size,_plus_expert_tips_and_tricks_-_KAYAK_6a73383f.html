All passengers are allowed one piece of carry-on luggage and a personal item. However, there are some important differences from US carriers. Here’s what else to know about Air France carry on size and other key intel. Find Air France flights Air France carry-on size: The basics Air France refers to carry-on bags as hand baggage. All Economy passengers are allowed one piece of hand baggage and one personal item. Passengers traveling in Premium, Business, or La Première cabins are allowed two hand baggage items and one personal item. Carry-on bagPersonal itemMax dimensions21.7 x 13.8 x 9.9 in11.8 x 15.7 x 5.8 inMax weight Economy and Premium cabin26.4 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)26.4 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)Max weight in the Business cabin or in La Première40 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)40 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item) The combined weight limit is significantly lower than most limits for major airlines in the US and can catch passengers by surprise. Air France does not count items such as jackets or duty free shopping bags toward its hand bag allowance, which is helpful. Air France carry-on rules for traveling with infants Fortunately, Air France has fairly generous carry-on policies for parents or caregivers traveling with little ones. But it’s still helpful to familiarize yourself with the rules ahead of time. If your child is traveling on your lap (which is allowed until they are two years old), you may bring one piece of hand baggage. A stroller will count toward this allowance; see below for more info. However, you can also check a stroller and a car seat as hold luggage for no extra charge. This is a nice extra for parents who want to use these items during their trip but don’t need them during transit. If your child has their own seat, they have the same carry-on allowances as adult passengers, depending on the ticket fare category. Are strollers allowed as carry-on bags on Air France? Depending on space availability and the aircraft, some strollers may be accepted in the cabin. Depending on the type of stroller, the following size limits apply: Small foldable stroller: dimensions cannot exceed 5.9 x 11.8 x 39.4 in Other foldable strollers: These count toward your child's hand baggage allowance. Once folded, the stroller cannot exceed 21.7 x 13.8 x 9.8 in. If you’re traveling on an Air France partner from the US (such as Delta) and connecting to an Air France flight elsewhere (Europe, for example), the carriers’ differing carry-on policies can be confusing. Delta does not specify a weight limit for carry-on luggage, while Air France does (and it’s only 26.4 pounds). This means that your carry-on baggage might be fine for the Delta leg, but over the limit for the Air France one. It may not be an issue, but it’s helpful to keep in mind – and an incentive to pack light.What extra items can you bring on board Air France flights? Fortunately, Air France allows passengers to bring extra items on board that do not count toward your hand bag allowance. The following items are neither considered a personal item nor hand baggage: A jacket, coat, or any other clothing item you may be wearing An umbrella Duty-free items purchased on board or at the airport Children’s items, such as strollers What are the carry-on rules for musical instruments on Air France? Musical instruments smaller than 45 in (115 cm) in total dimensions are considered a standard hand baggage item and are included in your baggage allowance. However, keep in mind that your only other allowed item will be a personal item that fits under the seat in front of you. Musical instruments larger than the above dimensions require approval from Air France at least 48 hours prior to your flight’s departure. In this case, instruments will be placed not in overhead buts but on one or more additional seats (the fare for which the passenger is required to pay).Air France carry-on FAQs Still have questions about Air France carry on bag size or other concerns? Read on for expert answers. How strict is Air France about carry-on size? It depends on several factors: how full the flight is; the discretion of gate agents; and a passenger’s status with the airline. Some passengers have reported that Air France conducts weight checks in its hub of Charles de Gaulle (CDG) prior to departure. As a result, it’s highly recommended for passengers to be familiar with the rules – and understand the risks (a fee to check an oversized or overweight bag) if you’re tempted to bring on more than the allowance. Can I bring a backpack and a purse on Air France? Yes, assuming that both fall within Air France carry-on size dimensions. Top three Air France carry-on luggage tips from expert traveler Blane Bachelor Tip #1: Use overhead bin space wisely I appreciate that Air France doesn’t count items like duty free shopping bags and jackets toward hand baggage allowance. That said, please don’t abuse the privilege – and always wait to see if there’s enough overhead bin space before you stuff in your jacket or shopping bags. Tip #2: Expect carry-ons to be checked on full flights As with other major carriers, passengers on Air France’s lowest fare category – Economy Light – are allowed two carry-on items. However, if the flight is full, these passengers’ hand bags will be the first in line to be checked, fortunately, for free (unless they’re oversized or overweight, in which case, you may be charged). Tip #3: Be prepared for carry-on weight checks I personally have never had my carry-on bags weighed on an Air France flight (knock wood). But I’ve heard plenty of other passengers have, most often at Charles de Gaulle. Since Delta Air Lines, an Air France partner airline, has a higher carry-on weight allowance, this can be tricky to navigate for international connections. But it’s definitely something to be aware of so it doesn’t come as an unpleasant surprise during your trip. Still have questions about Air France carry-on size? Luggage policies can be confusing. For an easy way to compare carry-on rules across airlines, check out our carry-on luggage guide. Need help deciding between a carry-on or checked bag? Or perhaps you’re stuck on what to pack? We have plenty of handy tips for that, too. Finally, don’t forget to check what’s allowed in a carry-on before you head to the airport. How was this guide created? Carry-on policies can be tricky, and, let's face it, pretty dry. We get it: That’s why we team up with travel experts, decipher the details, and create guides designed to make travel planning easier.
