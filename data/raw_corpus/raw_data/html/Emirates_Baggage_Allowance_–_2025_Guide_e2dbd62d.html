Emirates’ fleet is about 300 strong, super swanky, and its hub is the Dubai International Airport. A comparatively young airline, Emirates was founded in 1985 and, in that short time, has become one of the world’s leading carriers in terms of profit earned and tonnage flown.

Note that handbags and laptop bags count as carry-on items.

However, if the cabin overhead storage spaces are full, you may be forced to check it in the hold. As such, it’s always a good idea to call ahead and secure the additional space if you will need the accessory in-flight. Passengers who use wheelchairs may check a fully collapsible one, for no extra charge, in addition to standard fare and cabin luggage allotments. Tired of searching for luggage options online? Download Our App Today To Ensure Stress Free Travel Emirates Checked Baggage Emirates bills itself as having “one of the most generous baggage allowances in the world.” The airline’s checked luggage allotments are based on a calculation that considers origin, destination, cabin class, and ticket fare. Depending on your route, Emirates may use either a weight model or a per-piece model. Spending time in Dubai? Try our luggage storage options in the UAE. Emirates Checked Baggage Allowance: Per-Piece Model The table below outlines Emirates’ checked baggage allowance for flights to the Americas from Africa, Asia, Australia / New Zealand, and the Middle East, in addition to all routes taking off in Africa and heading to the Americas, Asia, Australia / New Zealand, or the Middle East.

If your route starts in Africa, and you bought an Economy Special ticket before May 11, 2020, you can check two pieces of luggage that weigh up to 23 kg each. If your journey begins in the Americas, Asia, Australia, or New Zealand and includes a stopover in Dubai that’s 24-hours-long or more, the weight baggage model applies, not the per-piece one. Members of Emirates’ frequent flyer programs may enjoy a higher baggage allowance in some circumstances. Call to find out. Emirates Checked Baggage Allowance: Weight Model All other Emirates flights not outlined above in the per-piece baggage allowance model use a weight system. Instead of limiting passengers to the number of items they can check, limits are based solely on weight.

Emirates Weight Checked Baggage Anomalies People with Economy Special tickets between UAE and India enjoy a 25 kg limit. People departing from Australia or New Zealand with an Economy Saver ticket bought on or after November 26, 2019, enjoy a 30 kg limit. Members of Emirates frequent flyer programs may enjoy a higher baggage allowance in some circumstances. Call to inquire. Emirates Checked Baggage Exceptions Passengers with crutches or braces may check them free of charge. Passengers transporting a dialysis machine can check it free of charge. Assistance dogs may be checked in the hold but are not allowed in the cabin. Explore our global luggage storage options. Emirates Excess Baggage Policies Emirates ticket holders can pay to increase their baggage allowances. Note that any luggage item exceeding 300 cm (118 in) cannot be checked on any Emirates commercial flight. It must be sent by Emirates freight or shipped by a third party. Emirates Excess Baggage Policy: Weight Model If you’re on a flight using the Emirates weight model baggage allowance, you can buy additional kilos, in five-kilo blocks, up to a maximum of 25. Purchasing the extra baggage space online — up to four hours before departure — will save you money; the first 5 kg add-on pack is 50 percent cheaper online than the check-in-desk price, and 20 percent less for each subsequent add-on weight pack. Here’s a table of Emirates additional baggage fees based on the route. Note that the airline uses the United States dollar as its standard legal tender. If you’re paying in another currency, the transaction day exchange rate applies. To / FromMiddle East / South AsiaAfricaFar EastEuropeAustralia and New ZealandMiddle East / South Asia$20$30$30$30$30Far East$30$40$15$40$30Europe$30$40$40$15$50Australia and New Zealand$40$50$30$50$15 So let’s say you have a business-class ticket from London to Madrid and have 65-kg-worth of luggage. The first 40 kg is included in the price of your fare. The next 5 kg would cost $7.50 if you bought it online, or $15 at the airport. The additional four 5-kg packs needed to reach 65 would cost $12 each if purchased ahead of time and $15 each at the check-in desk. Ultimately, your additional baggage fees (for flights using the weight model) would be $55.50 if purchased at least 4 hours before the flight and $75 if bought at the airport. Emirates Excess Baggage Policy: Per-Piece Model If you’re on a flight using Emirates’ per-piece luggage model, you can pay to bring more bags. The maximum number of checked items per ticket holder is 10, which includes allowances associated with your fare and cabin. Purchasing additional luggage space online, up to four hours before departure, saves you money. However, you can only buy a max of three overage items online; the remaining bags are always charged the full rate. Emirates’ full excess baggage fee, under its per-piece model, is $200 per bag. The online price is 50 percent off the first piece of extra luggage and 20 percent off the other two, but only for those in the Economy class. Everyone else must pay the full fee for every piece of extra luggage.

Emirates Excess Baggage Fees: Weight Model Emirates charges for oversized and overweight luggage when using the weight model. It’s $75 per overweight parcel for flights originating in Africa or to/from the Americas, $250 if oversized, and $350 if oversized and overweight. If you buy additional luggage allowances for the same routes, the fees jump to $275 (overweight), $325 (oversized), and $400 (overweight and oversized) per item! (Pro tip: If your excess luggage fee costs climb into the hundreds, it’s almost always cheaper to ship the items through a third-party international shipper, like Stasher.) Emirates Sports Equipment Baggage Policy Most sports equipment can be checked on Emirates flights. However, anything larger than 300 cm (118 in) must be sent by Emirates freight or a third-party luggage shipper. Sporting EquipmentEmirates RulesSCUBA EquipmentAllowed as checked baggage; air canisters must be emptySporting / Hunting Weapons (target pistols, target rifles, air guns, safari rifles, hunting rifles)Must be unloaded, dismantled, and packed inside luggage or a gun case; all firearms and ammunition must be reported to Emirates at least three days in advance and approved by the airline; ammunition packs must be fully packed in something that does not contain the “explosives” symbol or word; cannot bring more than 5 kg (11 lbs) worth of sporting weapons and associated ammunition; people traveling to or within the UAE must get permission from UAE authorities ahead of timeSki and Snowboard EquipmentIn almost all cases, you can check ski and snowboarding equipment.
