Storage is provided by each Host under the Storage Agreement entered into between a Host and a Customer in accordance with clause 3 of these Conditions.1. Our Details and our Role1.1 Citystasher Ltd is a company incorporated in England and Wales with its registered address at 25 Barge Walk, London SE10 0FN, company registration number 09787338, VAT registration number 277 4568 55, email: [email protected], tel: +44 203 355 3544. ICO register number: ZA403276.1.2 Stasher makes available an online marketplace for Customers to find and book available Storage from Hosts. Storage locations are either (i) secure areas within our Hosts’ premises, typically, in separate rooms or (ii) access-code restricted lockers, which may be in a public space or located more privately at a Host’s premises. Non-public storage locations typically have security measures in place such as restricted access and/or lockable units and/or CCTV surveillance.1.3 Stasher does not itself act as a Host. Under the Host Conditions, each Host authorises us to act as the Host’s commercial agent to negotiate and conclude each Storage Agreement with the relevant Customer under clause 3 of these Conditions for the supply of Storage, only on the Host’s behalf. The geographical address and identity of Host will be specified in the relevant booking information (“Booking”) and the Storage Agreement. In this limited capacity, we are not a party to the Storage Agreement. We charge Hosts a commission for providing our services to them. We collect the Storage Fees due under the Storage Agreement on the Host’s behalf as the ‘merchant of record’ that you will see on your card or payment account statement.2. Bookings and Fees Payable to Hosts2.1 Customers may book Storage via the Website or Apps at any time. Please check each Host’s opening hours via the Website or Apps prior to Booking. To book Storage through the Website or Apps, you must register to create a data account in accordance with the Website Conditions (“Stasher Customer Account”) by following the instructions on the Website or Apps.2.2 Each Customer agrees to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update that information as necessary to keep it accurate, current and complete. Stasher reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Stasher Customer Account and access to the Website if any information provided to us by you proves to be inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party. You must immediately notify Stasher of any unauthorised your Stasher Customer Account by emailing [email protected]. You shall be solely responsible and liable for use of your Stasher Customer Account, whether or not you have authorised those actions, unless they occur after you have notified us of any unauthorised use.2.3 When placing a Booking, each Customer will be asked to provide certain information, such as: i) dates and approximate times for dropping off and picking up items, ii) number of items and iii) any relevant notes to the order. In addition, each Customer will be asked to provide customary billing information, such as name, billing address and contact details. Each customer will also be asked to provide payment card information to a third party payment provider and each Customer’s payment card will be debited at the time of Booking. Once payment is confirmed, a Customer’s Booking transaction and payment is complete, and the Customer will receive an e-mail confirmation summarising his confirmed Booking. All payments by Customers to Stasher and by Stasher to Hosts will be processed through the Stripe online payment system, unless clearly stated otherwise. Payments made through Stripe will be subject to their automatic fraud checks. Please see www.stripe.com/radar for more information.2.4 Customers are reminded that Storage must be booked through the Website or Apps. Hosts are not permitted to accept cash payment in store and Customers must not attempt to pay for Storage in cash or otherwise outside the Website or Apps.2.5 The fees for each transaction are displayed in the pricing section of the Website or Apps and are stated inclusive of VAT. Fees are charged on a time of Storage basis, so if a Customer fails to comply with his stated Storage and collection times, additional charges may be debited to his payment card.2.6 After luggage storage is complete, the Customer will receive an email with a link to submit feedback.2.7 If the Customer does not provide feedback within 7 days following the completion of luggage storage, a default 5-star rating will be automatically assigned to their booking. This default rating includes only a numerical score and does not encompass a written review. If the Customer submits feedback or raises a complaint, the automatic rating will not be applied.3. Storage Agreement with the Host3.1 Our hosts and locker partners are responsible for keeping your items safe during the storage period, whether stored in person or a Stasher-approved locker. All lockers and storage partners must meet strict safety and operational standards set by Stasher, including but not limited to restriction of access when not in public areas.3.2 The Website or Apps provides the opening times of each Host, and you are responsible for checking that these suit your Booking plans. By making a Booking and paying for Storage through the Website or Apps, you enter into a contract with the Host who provides that Storage on the standard terms and conditions displayed to you during the Booking process (and available here) which also form part of these Conditions (“Storage Agreement”). Stasher is not a party to the Storage Agreement.3.3 Each Customer will comply with the security arrangements specified or referred to by the Host in the Storage Agreement, including the provision of proof of Booking and proof of identity, inspection of the luggage stored, sealing of bags and/or photographing the luggage to record condition and, when Storage is through lockers, recording, keeping confidential and using the locker codes provided at the time of booking, using the lockers with due care and not damaging the lockers in any way. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in the Storage Agreement, only the Customer which deposits an item may collect that item.3.4 Each Customer is responsible for any injury or damage to the Host, its property (including any lockers used by the Customer) or any third parties caused by the items stored or by any negligent act or omission of the Customer. Each Host is responsible for any damage to, or loss or theft of, items stored with that Host unless the damage is caused by factors beyond the control of the Host.3.5 If a Host alters its opening hours (either generally or on a particular day) or closes due to unforeseen circumstances and this will affect an existing Booking by you, the Host must inform Stasher by email to [email protected] as a matter of urgency. Where a Host is not open to receive or deliver on a confirmed Booking, we will refund the Storage Fee paid by you and/or, where practicable and with your consent, to arrange a Booking and Storage Agreement with an alternative Host. In the case that you cannot access your bags at your pickup time, Stasher will attempt to make reasonable arrangements to get your bag to you.3.6 If you fail to collect your luggage at the time stated in the Storage Agreement, the Host must inform us. We will attempt to reach you and arrange for you to collect your luggage at a new time. Failing this, we will arrange for the collection of your luggage from the Host and delivery of your luggage to you, at your expense. If we are unable to contact you, and you have not contacted us or collected your bags within 7 days of the agreed date, or you fail to pay for the delivery of the bags to you within 7 days of the agreed date for payment, we will dispose of your luggage without further responsibility or liability to you or the Host. Customers are responsible for timely retrieval of their luggage at the designated pickup time. In the case of locker usage, timely pickup is essential. Stasher retains the right to resell the locker space, even if luggage is not retrieved by the booked pickup time. Therefore, customers acknowledge that Stasher bears no liability or responsibility for luggage left in lockers beyond the designated pickup time. When your booking time elapses, your luggage will no longer be covered by our guarantee. If you are unable to retrieve your booking on time, please contact customer support at https://stasher.com/support. They will be able to either extend your booking or arrange for your belongings to be kept in safe storage until you collect them.3.7 We, Stasher, hereby state that we act as the agent for our hosts in the issuance of invoices for the services rendered. As an agent, Stasher assumes responsibility for generating and delivering invoices on behalf of the hosts to the relevant parties. Any invoices issued by Stasher shall accurately reflect the services provided by the hosts, and all payments received by Stasher on behalf of the hosts shall be duly accounted for and disbursed to the respective hosts in a timely manner.3.8 Premier Inn Locker Trial: If you do not collect your belongings by the end of your booking period, the Premier Inn Team will remove them from the locker and store them securely for up to seven days. During this period, you may contact the Hotel directly to arrange collection. If your belongings are not claimed within seven days and we have not received further instructions from you, the Premier Inn team reserves the right to dispose of them without further liability. Once your booking period expires, Stasher is not responsible for the safekeeping, condition, or retrieval of any uncollected items. We do not provide insurance coverage for items left beyond the agreed storage period. If you anticipate being late, please contact Stasher support as soon as possible. We will do our best to assist, but storage beyond your booking time is at the Premier Inn’s discretion and may incur additional charges.3.9 Stasher shall not be liable for incidents arising from improper locker use, including but not limited to: failing to properly close the locker, forcing a door closed under pressure, sharing access codes, storing prohibited items, or not complying with the instructions outlined in these Terms and Conditions or the booking confirmation email. In particular, if the confirmation email specifies that the access and retrieval codes are valid for one-time use only, the Customer must strictly follow those instructions. Attempting to reuse such codes or forcing access after the code has expired constitutes misuse. In such cases, Stasher’s customer support may assist in reactivating the access mechanism within a reasonable timeframe, but any delays, missed transportation, or additional costs incurred due to this misuse remain the sole responsibility of the Customer. Stasher is under no obligation to offer compensation for incidents resulting from failure to follow these instructions.3.10 The Stasher’s Guarantee applies only to items properly stored inside a closed suitcase or bag. Stasher will not be liable for any item attached to, hanging from, or left outside the luggage.3.11 Pre-Damaged LuggageCustomers must ensure that all luggage and items presented for Storage are in good, secure, and serviceable condition at the time of drop-off. Any pre-existing damage, including but not limited to broken handles, torn fabric, defective zippers, dents, cracks, or other wear that may compromise the integrity of the item — must be disclosed to the Host before storage.Stasher and its Hosts will not be liable for damage, deterioration, or loss that arises from or is aggravated by a pre-existing defect or the inherent condition of the item prior to drop-off. If damage is reported after collection, Stasher may request photographic or documentary evidence showing that the item was undamaged at the time of deposit. Where such evidence is unavailable or inconsistent, Stasher reserves the right to reasonably reject claims under the Stasher Guarantee or otherwise.By depositing luggage, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that Stasher and the Host are not responsible for any damage to items that were already compromised, defective, or inadequately packed before storage.4.

Where the Host provides Storage through lockers that are accessed and used by the customer, the Host is responsible for monitoring the lockers and will notify Stasher if any lockers are damaged or cease to operate. Where the lockers are not in a public area, the Host is responsible for restricting access or supervising access to the area where the lockers are located.4.2 It is the responsibility of each Host to follow the safety checklist set out in the Annex to these Conditions, as amended by Stasher from time to time (“Safety Checklist”) when a Customer arrives with a Booking. This includes checking for proof of Booking and proof of the Customer’s identity as the Customer specified in the relevant Storage Agreement.

In these cases, the defaulting Host will not be entitled to receive any Storage Fee on the Booking and, if the Storage Fee has already been paid by Stasher to the defaulting Host it will be liable to Stasher for an amount equivalent to the Storage Fee due from Stasher to the alternative Host, which we may set-off against, and deduct from, the next Storage Fee payable by Stasher to the defaulting Host.4.6 Each Customer agrees not to store any of the prohibited items identified in Customer Condition 4 ‘Prohibited Items’.
