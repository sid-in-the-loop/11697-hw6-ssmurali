Prepare and sign the dispatch release to provide legal authorization for a flight to depart according to government and company regulations to expedite and ensure safety of flight. Analyze and evaluate meteorological conditions, aircraft position reports and aeronautical navigation charts to evaluate the progress of flight, determine potential hazards to safety of flight, and select the most desirable and economic route of flight. Compute the amount of fuel required for the safe completion of flight according to type of aircraft, distance of flight, maintenance limitations, weather conditions and minimum fuel requirements prescribed by federal aviation regulations. Prepare flight plans containing information such as maximum allowable takeoff and landing weights, weather reports, field conditions, NOTAMs, and many other informational components required for the safe completion of flight. Update the pilot in command of significant changes to weather or flight plan, and recommend flight plan alternates, such as changing course, altitude and, if required, enroute landings in the interest of safety and economy. This may include delaying or canceling flights if unsafe conditions threaten the safety of the dispatcher’s aircraft or passengers. Participate in yearly recurrent training courses covering aircraft systems, company operations policy, meteorology and Federal Air Regulations as required by the FAA. Also complete yearly operations familiarization or “jumpseating” for each aircraft the dispatcher is qualified in. Initial New Hire Training All dispatch training is conducted at SkyWest Airlines’ headquarters in St. George, Utah. Initial New Hire training includes more than 100 hours of formal classroom instruction and testing. A designated dispatch trainer will then conduct practical training until the trainee is deemed ready for a Competency Check. Initial New Hire training normally lasts two to three months. The Competency Check is conducted by an Air Transportation Supervisor (ATS). Upon successfully passing the “Comp Check,” the dispatcher will complete the certification process by participating in an Aircraft Familiarization or “jumpseat” time of five hours. All written tests administered during training require a score of 80 percent or better with one retake permitted. PayPay will begin on the first day of training. Base pay starts at $23.23 per hour, with raises occurring on an annual basis. Vacation and personal days are accrued according to hours worked. apply now Edit Application Support Quick Links Home Press Releases Route Map Careers EOE Website Accessibility Contact Privacy Terms Copyright Partners United Airlines Delta Air Lines Alaska Airlines American Airlines Media Press Releases Route Map Aircraft Story Ideas Image Gallery Affiliates Careers Open Jobs Career Guides Social Twitter Blog Glassdoor © 2025 SkyWest Airlines</content>
