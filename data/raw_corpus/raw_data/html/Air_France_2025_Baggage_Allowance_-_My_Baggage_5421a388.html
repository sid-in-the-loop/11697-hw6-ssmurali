However, for domestic travel, or travel within the EU, customs is not usually required. In all cases, you will pass through security checks, to which it’s likely your ID and Documents will be checked, so it’s a good idea to have these documents ready and available throughout your journey.Entry requirements vary from country to country. It’s very important that you research the exact requirements specific to you before you travel, as certain countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, and possibly bank statements. Your passport must also be valid for the full duration of your stay, with some countries requiring at least 6 months validity. However, all requirements will differ and are subject to your specific circumstances, such as duration of stay, purpose of travel, and the regulations that the country has set.We recommend sourcing information about entry requirements from the country’s official websites.Connecting FlightsConnecting flights refer to you taking multiple flights in order to reach your destination. This results in having a longer journey time, however, it’s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not. This is why more and more travellers are travelling light by shipping their luggage ahead.Many low-cost airlines don't offer connecting flights. This means it's your responsibility to manage your onward connections, and collect your baggage after each flight.If you’re unsure, we recommend that you contact your airline directly.⛔ Avoid Airline Baggage Fees ⚠️Ship your luggage with My Baggage and avoid large airline baggage fees.TrustpilotAdding additional baggage to your flight or incurring excess baggage fees at the airport can considerably increase the overall cost of travel.Thankfully, My Baggage offers a convenient and cost-effective luggage shipping service that allows you to ship a massive 30KG/66lbs per suitcase at fantastic low rates.
