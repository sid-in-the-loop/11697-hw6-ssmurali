Although they can be costly, there’s no doubt that traditional international removals services are the perfect option if you need to ship large, bulky items such as beds, sofas or even your car to your new home overseas. However, for those in need of a more cost-effective option, traditional international removals services may not be ideal.My Baggage offers a brand new approach to moving your personal belongings overseas. With our fast, convenient, reliable and low-cost door-to-door shipping services, My Baggage can offer a more feasible method of shipping (suitcases, boxes, bags, bike shipping, etc) to your new home abroad. For many people, it could be a much more cost-effective option to sell any large, bulky items and ship their most treasured belongings with My Baggage.Convenient and Reliable RemovalsMy Baggage’s convenient door to door services mean you don’t have to worry about leaving your belongings at a designated drop-off point or collecting them from a far away location, such as a port like many traditional international removal services. My Baggage collects your shipment from your doorstep and delivers straight to your destination.We know that when it comes to your luggage and personal belongings, it’s natural to feel apprehensive about handing everything over to a removals driver. However, at My Baggage, we strive to provide an international moving service that you know you can trust.What Can I Send?You can use My Baggage to ship your personal effects in suitcases, boxes, or even a mixture of both. You can also send typically large or oversized items, such as sports equipment, musical instruments, and bicycles, so long as they are appropriately packaged.

Get to know the country you’re moving to.Whether it’s Asia, America, Australia or a European country, the advice is always thesame: get to know the country before moving.Why?Every country is unique and has its own way of operating.As a result, it makes sense to know as much as possible about the country before youarrive.Research the local job market; is it booming or stagnating?Are jobs attractive to you in good supply in your chosen country?Understand the currency and how it will help or hinder your everyday life.If you’re lucky enough to have secured a job before you move, work out how much of your salary will go towards rent, taxes, food and transport.Think about potential language barriers.Will you live in an English-speaking country, or will your mastery of a second languagehelp you thrive in your new surroundings?2. Make sure all of your documents are correct and in date.Many people with dreams of a new life abroad are hindered by red tape because they didn’t know the issues existed.One example is that your passport needs to have at least six months left on it to travel to most countries in Europe.Familiarise yourself with your destination country’s immigration rules surrounding visasand passports.Luckily, there’s a thriving ex-pat community online, with forums jam-packed withinformation from people who made your exact journey.They’ll be able to guide you on what documents you need and advise you on things youwon’t necessarily find on a government website.One example of a helpful forum to find lots of information from people with greatexperience is the Expat Forum.3. Before you move abroad, sell your larger items.Surprisingly, many people decide to transport all of their worldly possessions to their new home country.But this is expensive and time-consuming. You can expect delays in getting your items of anything up to a couple of months.You might not be able to visualise your life without your comfy La-Z-Boy recliner chair or that mattress that allows you to sleep a solid eight hours every night. But there’s another way.Sell your larger items on Gumtree, eBay, Facebook Marketplace or Vinted.And once you arrive in your new country buy new ones. You’ll be surprised that many of the larger items you want can be significantly cheaper depending on where you visit.4. Find out how much money you need to satisfy your destination country’s financial requirements.Most countries accept immigrants if they abide by specific rules and plan to contribute to their new country’s economy.However, before being accepted into the country, you’ll most likely be asked to prove how you will support yourself in the short term.Each country has its own pre-requisites but expect to be asked to prove you have money in your bank account to support yourself.This could be anything from a few thousand pounds right up to tens of thousands of pounds.To find out more about your new country’s financial requirements, type into Google:[Country name] and ‘settlement funds’.5. Plan how to get all of your essentials to your new home.In tip three, we mentioned selling your larger items and buying new ones when you arrive.This isn’t always possible for various reasons, including items that are of sentimental value.If that’s the case for you, consider using a traditional removals company to help you transport those larger items.Ask important questions to the removals company like, “When will my items arrive at my new home?” and “Can I track items?”.For smaller items, and personal effects, up to 30kg, why not use My Baggage?

Understand the weather.The weather in a country dictates a lot of your preparation.For a Canadian winter, you’ll need thermal coats, socks, hats and gloves.And for a Florida summer, you’ll want to consider air conditioning, beachwear and loose-fitting clothes.In addition, the weather of a country also brings about other awkward things to factor in.Some of us arrive home from a week in Spain with more than just a few freckles.That’s because, when we’re not used to a climate, we can also be a feast for the local (un)friendly mosquito, who enjoys a meal at our expense.Find out as much as you can about the climate and find out about the bugs that thrive there and how best to protect your skin.7. Research the culture of your new home.One of the best things about moving to a new country is immersing yourself in a newculture.You’ll enjoy a front-row seat to a hotbed of authentic food, arts, architecture, areas of outstanding natural beauty and much more.But cultural differences can also cause some alarm if you’re not used to doing things a certain way.Let’s take one example.You’re in a restaurant in London and enjoy a beautiful meal and excellent service.You don’t feel pressured into it but give your server a £10 tip on top of the £100 bill.Contrast that with enjoying a similarly lovely meal in a New York restaurant.You receive your bill of $100 and tip the server $10.However, that can (and most likely will) be seen as an insult; the typically expected tip in New York is 15-20%.That’s an extreme example, of course, but it’s a good idea to try and understand the culture of your new country to avoid any embarrassing or awkward situations.8. Driving and communications.Two of the most important things to anyone that moves abroad is independence but the ability to remain in touch with loved ones back home.And in the modern era, we feel most independent when we know we have the ability to hop into our car and drive somewhere.But each country has a different transport infrastructure, and it’s good to know what to expect before you get behind the steering wheel.For example, if you’re moving from America to the UK, you’ll want to know that drivers travel on the road&#39;s left-hand side in the UK.Oh, and you’ll want to know that steering wheels in the UK are on the right side of the car, not the left side you’re used to back in the US of A.In 2021, super-fast Wi-Fi and 5G are a minimum expectation.And you’ll want to keep in touch with family back home through WhatsApp, Zoom and Skype.But to do that, you’ll, of course, need decent Wi-Fi.Before you move abroad, research Wi-Fi deals and find out from ex-pats what your new country’s 4G and 5G infrastructure is like.ConclusionMoving country can be one of the most exciting and fulfilling things you’ll ever do.But like any grand plan, you just have to work out the finer details. Luckily, many people have already trodden this path.And if you get active in the months before your big move on Ex-Pat forums and Facebook groups, you’ll be able to learn from their mistakes and thrive with their benefit of hindsight.
