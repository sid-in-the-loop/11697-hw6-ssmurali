You must include a customs form detailing the contents and purpose of your shipment. Failing to provide this form can lead to delays, with your shipment potentially being held at customs, returned to the sender, and incurring additional fees.To make the process as smooth as possible, My Baggage takes care of the paperwork for you. When you book with us, if customs forms are required, we’ll automatically generate them based on the information you provide. Simply answer a few quick questions, and we’ll submit the forms on your behalf to the customs authorities - saving you time and hassle!Frequently Asked Questions: Luggage Shipping & CustomsAt My Baggage, we know you may have questions about our luggage shipping service and the customs process. But don’t worry - we’re here to help! We’ve compiled answers to the most frequently asked questions to make everything as straightforward as possible.How does luggage shipping work?Shipping your luggage with a courier service like My Baggage is simple and hassle-free. We collect your bags from your door and deliver them to your destination. You’ll get full online tracking, so you can monitor your shipment every step of the way. To get started, just get an instant quote and book your collection online.How long does it take to ship luggage?Delivery times vary depending on where you're shipping to and the service you choose. We offer fast, reliable delivery worldwide, with express options available to some destinations in as little as 1–2 days. When you book, we’ll provide an estimated delivery time so you’ll know when to expect your luggage.Do I need to fill out customs forms when sending luggage?For domestic shipments (within the same customs zone, such as the EU, UK, or USA), no customs forms are required. For international shipments, customs clearance is required. When you book with My Baggage, we’ll generate your digital customs forms and any other necessary documents for you to complete online. In some cases, you may also need to provide additional details, such as a passport image page, depending on the country’s requirements. To avoid delays, customs documentation must be in the receiver’s name, as they should be the owner of the shipment. If the sender’s name differs from the receiver’s, customs may reject the shipment. Tip: Ensure both the sender and receiver names match the shipment owner’s name for smooth clearance.Do I need to declare the value of the items inside my luggage?You must declare the value of your items when completing customs forms. To demonstrate that your shipment consists of personal effects, it’s important to describe each item clearly. For example: 4 x Used Black Men's Cotton T-Shirts 1 x Pair Used Brown Leather Shoes (Size 8) 2 x Used Dark Blue Denim Jeans (Size Small) Providing clear and accurate descriptions reduces the risk of customs delays.Will I have to pay customs fees or import duties on my luggage?When shipping used personal effects, keeping a low declared value on customs forms can help minimise the chances of duties or taxes. However, customs fees may still apply depending on: The nature of your shipment The reason for sending (e.g., returning resident vs. sending a gift) The import rules of the destination country Customs decisions are beyond My Baggage’s control, so we recommend checking country-specific regulations.How long does customs clearance take when shipping luggage?Each shipment is subject to customs checks, and clearance times vary depending on: The country’s regulations The accuracy of your customs paperwork The shipment’s contents If your customs forms are completed correctly, your shipment should clear customs smoothly and arrive within the estimated delivery timeframe.Can customs inspect or open my suitcase?All shipments are subject to security and customs inspections, which means customs may open and inspect your shipment. Tip: Do not lock your luggage to avoid delays during customs checks.Do customs rules differ depending on the country I’m shipping to?Each country has its own import rules and regulations, so customs procedures vary based on your destination. We highly recommend researching country-specific customs policies to ensure compliance and prevent unexpected delays or fees.Simplified CustomsMy Baggage specialises in sending personal effects internationally. We offer a simplified customs process to our users and ensure all correct documentation is complete. My Baggage ServiceDigital Customs FormsWe will ask you a number of simple questions so we can create a set of digital custom forms for you. We will submit these forms on your behalf to the customs authority.Customs GuidanceWe offer helpful customs guidance for shipping personal effects. This is available online, and via phone and email if you have any questions. We will also submit the correct forms for shipping personal effects on your behalf.Potential of Lower DutiesThe majority of used personal effects shipments sent with My Baggage will have zero duties to pay. This is due to us submitting additional personal effects clearance forms and not simple commercial invoicesCommercial CourierPaper Customs FormsYou may have to print off custom forms and attach these to your items, even if some couriers allow digital customs for commercial goods, they may not provide additional personal effects clearance forms, these are important to avoid customs duties.Basic or No Customs GuidanceMany couriers are set up to ship commercial goods and may not be able to provide advice on shipping personal effects or be able to provide the correct free entry declaration forms for your destination country.Potential of Higher DutiesIf you send your item with a commercial courier you may have to pay duties as it could be cleared as a commercial shipment. Once customs have processed your shipment it can be very difficult to claim your items are personal effects if the correct paperwork was not provided.Get a quoteCollect fromUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d’IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunion, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweDeliver toUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d’IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunion, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweGet QuoteWhy use a Luggage Shipping Company?There are plenty of great reasons to use a luggage shipping service like My Baggage.
