Personal Effects Customs Clearance AustraliaImportant InformationShipping from the UKCustomers shipping to Australia from the UK may only send 1 bag or box per order with a declared value of up to $1000 AUD. You can however place multiple orders should you need to send more than one item.Shipping to Australia from countries other than the UKYou may ship more than one piece per order when shipping to Australia from countries other than the UK, however shipments with a declared value over $1000 AUD may attract a c. $100 formal clearance fee from Australian customs. The declared value is your estimated pre-owned resale value of the contents for customs purposes, it is not a replacement value for insurance purposes, in our experience a suitcase of used clothes is likely to carry a resale value of less than $200 AUD. Sending a larger shipment? Australia customs will typically expect a shipment of over 100kgs to have a declared customs value of over $1000 AUD, as such if sending more than 100kgs you may want to split the shipment across more than one order, or to ensure the declared value is over $1000 AUD and bear in mind it is likely the $100 formal clearance fee will be billed to you.Quarantine / BiosecurityAustralia has a strict Biosecurity System and shipments containing items such as foodstuffs, wooden products or items which have been contact with plants or animals may be selected for quarantine by Australia Border Force. Shipments sent to Australia by any means, including post, courier or freight are subject to the same rules. We currently find around 20 in every 1000 shipments sent by Send My Bag customers are selected for quarantine. While the decision to quarantine is taken by Australia Border Force agents and is outside of our control, tips to help avoid quarantine include:- If sending items such as hiking boots, sports equipment or tools that have been in contact with soil, plants or animals, ensure they are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, include this information on your packing list.- Label items clearly on your packing list, if a description is vague and border force is unsure what something is they may quarantine your shipment as a precaution. Examples of shipments which have been quarantined include; - A horse saddle; as this is an item directly associated with use with animals, it is likely this item would always be quarantined, even if it has been labelled as cleaned.- A shipment containing some makeup items but one item was listed on the packing list as "powder". This description was too vague and it was quarantined as a precaution. If more detail had been provided, e.g. "cosmetic blusher powder" border force may have taken a different decision.If your item is quarantined it will be held by border force for several weeks and you will be required to pay a quarantine fee of c. A$120 directly to our agent in Australia before border force will release it for onward delivery.

General Personal Effects Customs InformationPersonal effects are typically defined as used items which have been in the sender's possession for 6 months or more. If your shipment is checked by customs and is found to contain brand new or commercial items, you shipment may not be assessed as personal effects. Keep this in mind if you are sending Christmas gifts or other new items. Please check with customs so you are aware of potential customs duties, follow any advice given and attach all necessary documentation.In order to demonstrate that your shipment consists of personal effects, you will be required to complete a brief non-generic packing list online, entries to be made in the format: "5 x Cotton Dresses, 2 x Jeans, 3 x Pair of Gloves", and so on, rather than as "10 x Used Clothing".As customs processes and allowances vary by country, we advise all customers take 5 minutes to check how their personal circumstances and what they are sending will be assessed under the prevailing customs regulations of the destination.More information is available on our customs information page. Customs Clearance TimeOver 95% of shipments on this route will not be stopped by customs, however, when a bag is stopped by customs for any reason (missing documentation, impromptu inspection, prohibited contents, commercial contents or further information required) Send My Bag records how long customs hold it for. Our historical statistics for this route indicate shipments stopped for any reason other than quarantine inspection typically are released within one working day once any query has been resolved e.g. missing paperwork. Shipments that require quarantine clearance by Australian Border Force will typically be held for up to 10 working days before they are approved for import and released. Shipping Gifts to AustraliaAustralia allows gifts up to a value of $1000 AUD to enter the country tax and duty free. Where multiple gifts are sent for different people and the total value exceeds $1000 AUD, duty and tax will become applicable. Australian customs does not allow items within a consignment to be split for the purposes of tax and duty calculation, if sending gifts valued over $1000 AUD you could consider sending them as separate shipments.All shipments, regardless of gift status, are subject to inspection by Australian Border Force.

About Australia Australia - also known as OZ, or the Land Down Under - is a popular holiday and emigration destination, with most regions enjoying pleasant temperatures throughout the year. The sheer expanse of the country makes it a wonderful and intriguing country to visit. It’s the sixth largest country on the planet and includes the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. Australia is made up of a range of landscapes, from mountains to deserts, reefs, forests, beaches, and cosmopolitan cities. If you’re looking for an adventure holiday or if you plan to start a new life for you and your family, Australia really is the place to go. As you may know, Australia’s summer ranges from December to February, hence Christmas BBQs on the beach. This means that winter falls between June and August with cooler temperatures. However, as Australia is so big, the country covers a number of climate zones with some places much cooler than others.Some of the top activities and must-see sites in Australia include snorkelling or diving round the Great Barrier Reef, taking a trip to Uluru and exploring the Blue Mountains National Park. It’s a great place to go trekking, mountain climbing, or to enjoy extreme sports. If you like to take it much, much easier, then Australia has some of the best beaches in the world. Why not spend the day at Bondi Beach, one of the most famous beaches there is. A bit further afield is Christmas Island which offers the perfect escape on its pristine beaches.If you prefer a cosmopolitan holiday, Australia’s vibrant and lively cities make a brilliant destination. The capital, Canberra, is the largest landlocked city and offers a unique insight into Australian life. Influenced by garden cities, buildings are intermixed with parks and gardens. The larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne are the more popular destinations for tourists and those looking to emigrate. Sydney, of course, has its Opera House and is the site of the first British Colony in Australia, and is thus steeped in colonial history. Melbourne is in the state of Victoria. It is a fantastic cultural city filled with museums and galleries, and is home to a number of festivals. Please explore this page further to find out about Send My Bag’s shipping service to Australia. Other Ways of Shipping to Australia As well as sending parcels, baggage and luggage to Australia you could investigate the following options for shipping items internationally, especially if you need to send large, bulky items like pieces of furniture. Air Freight to AustraliaAir freight is one way you could send items, such as a table or armchair, to Australia. Sending items by air freight usually takes one to two days, which is usually faster than sea freight shipping, but typically more expensive. The amount you will be required to pay will depend on the weight and size of your shipment. You will likely also have to use the services of a customs agent to handle customs clearance for you. And, you will need to arrange how to get your items to and from the airport. Costs could, therefore, quickly mount up. If you send internationally by air freight to Australia your items would likely arrive at one of the major airports, such as Sydney Airport or Melbourne Airport.Sea Freight and Container Shipping to AustraliaYou could choose sea freight rather than air freight to transport your possessions to Australia. This is an option if you don’t need to receive your items immediately. Again, this option is usually used when shipping large bulky items, such as a sofa or even a car. Sea freight usually means shipping items in large containers loaded onto cargo ships. It can be cheaper than air freight, but you will still need to use the services of a customs agent and will need to sort out how to get your items to and from the ports. So, the cost could end up being more than you first expected. When using container shipping to Australia your items will most likely arrive by ship at one of the major sea ports, such as the Port of Brisbane or the Port of Melbourne.Shipping Goods to AustraliaWhen shipping goods to Australia you need to be aware of the current customs rules. You should be aware of any duty that you need to pay and what items are allowed to be shipped to Australia, which items are restricted, and which are entirely prohibited. Take a look at the prohibited items and customs sections on this page for more information.
