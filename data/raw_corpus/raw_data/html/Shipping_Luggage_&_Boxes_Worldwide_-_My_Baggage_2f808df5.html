Say goodbye to the nightmare of hauling your suitcase or bags from your home and through train stations, taxis and airports; our baggage shipping service can save you from all of the hassle and stress.What’s more, when you book a bag on your flight, you have to keep in mind your airline’s restrictive baggage weight allowances when packing up all of your personal belongings. It means you may be left with two options, either of which are ideal; paying the extortionate excess baggage fees at the check-in desk, or leaving many of your beloved personal belongings behind. When travelling for any reason, especially long-haul, it’s not ideal.Thankfully, My Baggage allows you to ship a generous 66lb per item at fantastic low rates. You also have the option to pay extra for even heavier bags, if you need to. With My Baggage, you’ll never have to worry about leaving any of your possessions behind.Shipping your excess baggage with My Baggage also makes that eager wait for the appearance of your suitcase at the luggage carousel in the airport a thing of the past.
