To move abroad as an expat and transport personal effects securely. How much will it cost to ship my Boxes?The cost to ship your boxes will depend on the collection and delivery country, the size and weight of your boxes, and the delivery option you choose. My Baggage provides affordable box shipping worldwide, and you can easily obtain an instant quote.How long will it take for my Boxes to arrive?My Baggage provides fast box shipping options, with some deliveries arriving in as little as one working day.

When placing your order, we will provide a delivery estimate. Please note that collections and deliveries take place between 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.What type of Boxes should be used?To ensure a smooth shipping experience, we recommend using strong, double-walled cardboard boxes to package your personal belongings securely. You can add bubble wrap, newspaper, or other protective materials inside the box to keep your items safe during transit. While My Baggage does not supply packaging materials, you can purchase suitable boxes online. Here are some examples of common box sizes & weights we accept: 20KG: 45 x 45 x 45cm / 44lbs: 18 x 18 x 18in 30KG: 50 x 50 x 55cm / 66lbs: 20 x 20 x 22in Before shipping, please check that your box meets our requirements using our size checker. Avoid using crisp boxes or plastic storage containers, as they are often too fragile and may split during transit. For more detailed guidance, please visit our packaging page or contact our customer support team.What destinations can I ship my Boxes to?My Baggage offers a global shipping service to a wide range of international destinations. Whether you’re sending your boxes to Europe, the USA, or beyond, we’ve got you covered. To check if we deliver to your intended location, simply select your collection and delivery countries from the drop-down menus when getting an instant quote.Do my Boxes need to go through Customs?If you’re shipping boxes internationally, your shipment will need to go through customs in the destination country. A completed customs form is legally required for this process. Don’t worry - when you book with My Baggage, we’ll automatically generate the necessary customs forms for you to complete online. This saves you time and makes the process much easier. You’ll simply need to answer a few questions and declare the value of the items in your shipment. For domestic shipments or shipments within the same customs zone, such as within the EU, customs checks are not required, and no customs forms will be needed. Most My Baggage shipments clear customs quickly and are often free from duties and taxes, as many countries provide a generous duty-free allowance for personal effects. However, customs processes and allowances vary between countries, and My Baggage does not have direct links to customs authorities. We recommend researching the customs regulations of your destination country before booking your shipment to understand any potential duties or taxes. Be sure to follow all advice and requirements provided by the customs authority. Below you can see how our simplified customs process is designed to save you time and hassle compared to a commercial courier.Simplified CustomsMy Baggage specialises in sending personal effects internationally. We offer a simplified customs process to our users and ensure all correct documentation is complete. My Baggage ServiceDigital Customs FormsWe will ask you a number of simple questions so we can create a set of digital custom forms for you. We will submit these forms on your behalf to the customs authority.Customs GuidanceWe offer helpful customs guidance for shipping personal effects. This is available online, and via phone and email if you have any questions. We will also submit the correct forms for shipping personal effects on your behalf.Potential of Lower DutiesThe majority of used personal effects shipments sent with My Baggage will have zero duties to pay. This is due to us submitting additional personal effects clearance forms and not simple commercial invoicesCommercial CourierPaper Customs FormsYou may have to print off custom forms and attach these to your items, even if some couriers allow digital customs for commercial goods, they may not provide additional personal effects clearance forms, these are important to avoid customs duties.Basic or No Customs GuidanceMany couriers are set up to ship commercial goods and may not be able to provide advice on shipping personal effects or be able to provide the correct free entry declaration forms for your destination country.Potential of Higher DutiesIf you send your item with a commercial courier you may have to pay duties as it could be cleared as a commercial shipment. Once customs have processed your shipment it can be very difficult to claim your items are personal effects if the correct paperwork was not provided.Preparing your Boxes for ShippingOnce you’ve placed your order with My Baggage, it’s time to get your boxes ready for their journey! Just follow our simple packaging guidelines to keep your belongings safe during transit, and don’t forget to securely attach the provided shipping label to your box. For extra peace of mind, we recommend including an extra label inside the box. And remember to double-check that there are no prohibited items in your shipment.My Baggage includes free compensation as standard, with the option to purchase enhanced cover when you place your order. Although properly packed items are rarely damaged, please note that some items are classified as non-compensation.
