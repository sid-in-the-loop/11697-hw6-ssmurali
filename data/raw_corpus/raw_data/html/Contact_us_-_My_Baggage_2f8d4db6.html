If you are staying in halls of residence then your item(s) will be collected from your reception or your usual collection point, please check with your university where this is. If you are staying in a flat or house the driver will come to your front door. What if I am not available for collection? The item needs to be available for collection. A friend can hand the item to the driver or if you are sending within the UK (inc N. Ireland) you can leave the item in a safe place with a signed note on the front door, do this at your discretion.
