Air Canada has an automatic sizer that allows you to check your carry-on size. Stickpen, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons Air Canada Baggage Allowances for Carry-on Can you bring a backpack and a carry-on to fly with Air Canada? Of course, as long as both are within the regulated size. New Hand Luggage Policy From Jan 2025, if you fly on the basic fare, you are only entitled to one free personal item bags. This applies to flights within Canada, to/from the U.S. (Hawaii and Puerto Rico included), and to/from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Basic fare fliers on international routes continues to enjoy carrying one carry-on and one personal item for free. If you fly internationally on a Basic fare with a connecting flight in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Central America or the Caribbean, you can still bring a standard carry-on and a personal item on board. Hand Luggage Size And Weight The maximum size of hand luggage is 21.5 x 9 x 15.5 inches (55 x 23 x 40 cm), and your personal item bag must be within 13 x 6 x 17 inches (33 x 16 x 43 cm). Your hand luggage will be placed in the overhead bin, and your personal items will be under the seat. Though there is no mention of a weight limit, you must make sure that your luggage is light enough to stay in the head cabin. The list of personal item bags accepted includes briefcases, laptops, sports racquets, musical instruments, camera bags, garment bags, and even cats or small dogs in their carrier. Additional Items If you travel with an infant, you will be allowed to bring another bag for your child’s belongings. This only applies if your child sits on your lap.

Passengers can bring additional items such as a jacket, umbrella, duty-free items, and assistive devices (wheelchairs, crutches, etc.) without them counting against the carry-on limit. See more details here. How Strict Is Air Canada About Carry-On Size? This airline is said to be quite strict with carry-on size. Most people say that they always check your hand luggage in a sizer before every flight and are ready to charge extra. However, there have been some exceptions when people were let on despite their luggage being slightly bigger. Then what if my carry-on is 1 inch too tall? Or simply was stuffed too much that it puffed up? They might probably accept anyway. But there is no guarantee. The chance is low if your flight has a small plane. If you intend to bring a little bigger bag, choose one that can be squeezed like the CabinZero Cabin bag. Liquid Air Canada follows the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority requirements for liquid and gel. Basically, it is the same as the TSA 3-1-1 liquid rule. You have to place your liquid into containers less than 100ml (3.4oz). All of them must fit into a clear bag with a capacity of less than 1L. When checking in, you must place this bag in a bin. Each passenger is only allowed 1 bag with the dimensions of 6 x 9 in (15.24 x 22.86 cm) or 8 x 7 in (20 x 17.5 cm). Other liquids that exceed this requirement on your carry-on will be confiscated. If you bring food that contains liquid, such as jam, pudding, etc., it must also be in a clear 100ml container and fit into your 1L bag. If you have connected flights, Air Canada advises you not to buy duty-free liquid or alcohol, as you will have to put them into your checked luggage. You can also bring some special items on board. First are your infant care products, such as diapers and strollers. Your strollers must be collapsible and shorter than 36 inches (92 cm). You can’t smoke on the plane, but you can keep your electronic cigarette in your hand luggage. Air Canada Checked Baggage Allowance & Fees For the checked baggage, there are many more requirements from Air Canada. The price varies for different flights at different times. The surest way to calculate this fee is on the Air Canada website. Size And Weight Limit The luggage price with Air Canada varies based on your flights and your ticket class. Photo by smolaw11 - stock.adobe.com The maximum weight for a checked bag is 50lb (23kg). The maximum linear dimensions per bag are 62 in (158cm). For Business Class and some international flights, the weight limit per bag may increase to 32 kg (70 lb). Your luggage must weigh less than the limit to not be charged an extra fee. Allowance by Fare Type The checked baggage allowance depends on the fare type and route. For example, Economy Class passengers on domestic flights generally pay for checked baggage, while Business Class passengers may have one or more checked bags included in their fare. For Basic and Standard fare, usually, the fee for the first checked bag within Canada and from Canada to the U.S., Mexico, or the Caribbean will be around $35-$42. The price for the second checked bag on the same routes is around $50-$60. For other international routes, the prices will be much higher, from $75 to $100. For Flex fare, the first checked bag is free. For Latitude fare, both checked bags are free. Initally, Comfort economy fliers only have one complimentary checked bags. But here is a great news: from Jan 2025 they will be able to check 2 free bags. Air Canada Excess Baggage Fees Fees apply to baggage exceeding the standard weight and size limits. If your bag weighs from 50lb to 70lb (23-32kg), it will be counted as overweight. Those from 63 in to 11 in (160-292cm) total linear are considered oversize. Each oversized or overweight bag will incur a minimum fee of $100. If your luggage exceeds these limits, it may be counted as an additional bag, which could result in further charges. For luggage larger than these sizes, you will have to contact Air Canada Cargo to have it shipped with another service. Hold bags that reach a certain threshold will be denied entry on board and won’t be flying on the same flight as yours. You can pay for your extra luggage online, at the self-serve kiosks, or at the counter. The transaction will use the currency of your current destination. Some airports don’t accept cash payments, so be prepared to lose some conversion fees. Credit and debit cards are accepted. How To Book A Ticket And Check In With Air Canada It’s the usual business if you know how. Photo by luengo_ua - stock.adobe.com Just like with many airlines, booking a flight and checking in with Air Canada is pretty straightforward. Here’s how you can do it. Booking The best way to book a ticket with Air Canada is on their official website. There are more promotions, and it is also more trustworthy than other third parties. The process of booking your ticket on their website is also very simple. All you have to do is fill in your travel information, such as your departure city and destination. Then, a selection of flights that suit your needs will appear. Here, you can choose the most suitable one. After this step, you can enter your information, such as passenger names, IDs, etc., and finish your payment. When buying the ticket, you can also choose your desired seat. But don’t worry if you accidentally skip this step, as you can do so at check-in. Check-in To check in, there are 02 options. You can do so online or directly at the airport. Boarding Time The check-in time will be opened 240 minutes before every flight and closed depending on the flight. For flights within Canada, the counter will be closed 45 minutes before departure. The time for other flights will be 60-90 minutes. After this time, the counter will not accept any luggage. The boarding gate will be opened 30 minutes before departure for flights within Canada and to/from the U.S. For other international flights, the opening time will be longer, 45 minutes before departure. Boarding gates will be closed 15 minutes before departure for every flight. Online Via App If you want to save time, it is recommended that you check in 24 hours before your departure with the Air Canada app to avoid the long queue. In this way, you can personally choose or change your seat, change to a same-day flight, upgrade your ticket class, or indicate the number of luggage you bring along, etc. However, you still have to visit the self-serve kiosks or the baggage counter to print and attach your baggage tag before dropping your checked bag off at the counter. At The Airport If you prefer to do it at the airport, you can go to the self-serve kiosks or at the counter. In this way, you will have to arrive early at the airport to avoid missing the deadlines. Be sure to invest in an air-travel-friendly bag for your Air Canada flight. Conclusion Overall, Air Canada's carry-on size is not so much different from other airlines, but it is even better.
