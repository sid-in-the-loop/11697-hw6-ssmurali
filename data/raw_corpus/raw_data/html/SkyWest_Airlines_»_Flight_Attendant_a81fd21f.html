They will also receive $5 each paycheck for uniform maintenance such as alterations and dry cleaning. As a representative of SkyWest, our flight attendants are expected to follow all uniform and appearance guidelines. Extreme hair styles and colors are not permitted. Visible tattoos are permitted with limitations based on dimension and location. Tattoos that do not fall within these guidelines must be covered by the uniform or with skin tone compatible tattoo makeup. Bandages are not an approved form of tattoo coverage. Offensive tattoos must not be visible. Single stud nose piercings that are 2mm or smaller are allowed and two piercings are allowed per ear. Gauges must be plugged with clear or skin toned plugs and must not exceed ½”. Other facial, mouth, or tongue piercings are not permitted. Each new flight attendant can expect to be on reserve until they build enough seniority to become a line holder. The time spent on reserve varies depending on the growth within the assigned domicile. When a flight attendant is on reserve, they are on-call and expected to be available during assigned reserve blocks to cover trips due to sick calls, vacations, etc. While on reserve, flight attendants may be away from home up to five days a week and scheduled to work up to 14 hours each day. If contacted to work a trip while on reserve, flight attendants must be checked in at the airport and ready for duty within two hours. It can be very difficult to commute while on reserve and it is highly recommended that flight attendants relocate to their assigned domicile. All assigned trips will begin and end in the assigned domicile. SkyWest flight attendants on reserve will not exceed 19 duty days per month. Training Initial New Hire Training: Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training is held in Salt Lake City, Utah at the SkyWest Airlines Hangar.

Failure to pass will result in dismissal from the training. Domicile Domiciles will be assigned following the end of Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training. Assignments will be based on operational need, as well as company seniority. Those who prefer a different domicile than they are assigned may submit a transfer request after they have completed IOE. Transfer times vary depending on the growth in the desired domicile Initial Operating Experience The Initial Operating Experience (IOE) is the second phase of Flight Attendant Training.Once IOE has been successfully completed, the new hire will be assigned a reserve work schedule at his/her assigned domicile. If relocation is required, the new hire will be given four days to relocate to the assigned domicile upon completion of initial new hire ground training (prior to IOE). SkyWest will provide up to three nights of hotel accommodations at a trainee’s domicile if needed.Thirty to 90 days following IOE, the third and final phase of Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training will be conducted. This final phase, known as the Initial Line Check, must be completed with a satisfactory score. Seniority Seniority is determined by the flight attendant’s date of hire (the first day of training) and the last four digits of their Social Security number.

Flight attendants need to have the stamina needed to work up to 16 hours per day with frequent change in climate and weather conditions.
