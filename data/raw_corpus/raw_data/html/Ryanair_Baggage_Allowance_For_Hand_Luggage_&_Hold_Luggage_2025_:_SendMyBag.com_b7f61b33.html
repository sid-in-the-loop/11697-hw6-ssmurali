These flights are to be taken in December this year, but there are likely to be more deals popping up in the next few days. Why not grab one of these deals and avoid Ryanair's baggage fees by shipping your luggage to your destination with Send My Bag?25/10/2017: Ryanair New Cabin Baggage Policy PostponedThe new Ryanair cabin baggage policy, which states that any passengers without Priority Boarding will have their larger item of hand luggage placed in the hold, has now been postponed until 15th January, 2018 to allow passengers to get used to the idea.27/09/2017: Ryanair Travel Chaos to Continue for MonthsFollowing the disruption caused by Ryanair incorrectly scheduling staff holidays, the airline has now announced that it is suspending 34 routes over the winter period, including Newcastle to Faro and London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow.25/09/2017: No Insurance Pay-Outs for Many Ryanair PassengersAlthough Ryanair has offered limited compensation to those passengers affected by its cancelled flights, holidaymakers are unlikely to be reimbursed for any other aspects of their holiday they have missed out on. This is because most basic holiday insurance packages do not cover loss as a result of cancelled flights.18/09/2017: Flight Misery for Ryanair PassengersRyanair has cancelled approximately 2000 flights, leaving 315,000 passengers either stranded abroad, stuck at home and missing their holidays, or forking out hundreds of pounds to make other arrangements. This is a result of a blunder over the scheduling of pilot holidays.The knock-on effect of this scheduling error is likely to be enormous, especially for passengers among the 50 million people every year who choose to travel on self-connected flights. At the best of times these passengers have to do all the leg-work themselves when it comes to checking, reclaiming and rechecking their baggage onto different flights. If their Ryanair flights are cancelled, they will encounter all manner of difficulty trying to reorganise their itineraries, and all with a pile of baggage in tow.06/09/2017: Only Small Handbag is Guaranteed Hand LuggageNew Ryanair baggage rules mean that, unless passengers pay £5 for Priority Boarding, they will be forced to place their larger item of cabin baggage into the hold once they arrive at the boarding gate. This means that non-Priority customers will only be able to bring their small personal item on board with them.This is likely to cause problems for passengers who are unaware of the new policy and who have not prepared their hand baggage for the stresses and strains of being loaded into and out of the hold. Damaged hand luggage will likely become a common occurrence on Ryanair flights. There is now all the more reason to send your luggage to your destination and avoid altogether the hassle of flying with luggage.Ryanair News22/09/2020: Ryanair Warns of Potential Winter Base ClosuresAn internal memo seen by Ryanair pilots and crew has warned of possible base closures at Cork and Shannon in the winter season.17/08/2020: Ryanair Cuts Flights After Increase in EU Virus RatesFollowing the reintroduction of quarantine measures in the UK and Ireland for arrivals from several EU countries, Ryanair announce they will cut 20% of their flying capacity in September and October.07/08/2020: Ryanair Restores 60% of Flights in AugustRyanair announces it has restored 60% of its normal flight schedule in August.28/07/2020: Ryanair Still Flying to SpainBudget EU airline Ryanair will continue flights in and out of Spain as normal, despite the reintroduction of a 14-day quarantine on arrivals from the country into the UK.02/07/2020: Welsh Government Asks Ryanair to Stop FlightsRyanair flights departing Cardiff Airport are due to go ahead despite the travel guidance in Wales asking citizens to remain with 5 miles of their homes.
