Their rules are very similar to other airlines with some variations to be aware of. If you accidentally bring a bag that's too big - or too heavy - you could incur additional fees. Jet Blue's Bag Policy Jet Blue offers affordable ticket prices through what can be described as an a la carte model. Where some airlines allow free carry-on or checked bags, Jet Blue's basic fares give you the option to add these perks for a premium. Each passenger is allowed to bring a personal item on board free; these are small purses or backpacks that easily fit under the seat in front of you. If you arenâ€™t a Blue, Blue Plus, Blue Extra, or Mosaic member of the airline, there will be fees to bring any other bags. Jet Blue varies from other airlines in that Blue Basic passengers who bring a carry-on to the gate will be required to check the bag and pay the checked bag fee. These fees are $65 per bag for the first two bags and $180 for the third, unless you bought this service ahead of time. There are, of course, some exceptions to this rule. Jet Blue Military Bags Policy Jet Blue is dedicated to providing outstanding service to those who serve our country. To give back, they have a couple of perks for active duty military: Any active duty military personnel (and their dependents) traveling off duty each receive up to two free checked bags (maxing out at 50 pounds). Any active duty military (and their families) traveling on duty can bring up to five free checked bags (up to 99 pounds). In addition to their revised baggage policies, active duty military enjoy 5% off their base fare. Travel orders and a common access card are required to get these discounts. Jet Blue Baggage Fees If you donâ€™t qualify for the military discounts, you can still travel affordably with checked baggage by planning ahead. The rates above are prices you will pay at the airport when your fare doesn't include checked baggage allowance. Jet Blue baggage fees are divided into domestic (including the Caribbean and Latin America) and international travel (to the UK and Europe). On a domestic flight, a Jet Blue checked bag fee within the size and weight requirements listed below runs just $35. The second bag is an additional $45; a third bag will cost you $150. You can get discounts on your first two bags by paying your baggage fees in advance. Checking a bag for an international flight, meeting the same requirements as the domestic baggage costs $65 for the first bag, $105 for the second, and $200 for the third. Regardless of your destination, the bag must be under 62 linear inches, and the Jet Blue luggage weight limit is 50 pounds. Exceeding these limits will incur additional costs, bumping up your rates to $150 per bag until you exceed 80 inches or 99 pounds. If over the upper limits, the bag won't be accepted. With our luggage shopping guides, you can find the best luggage for your trip. Carry-on Bags Does Jet Blue allow Carry-ons? The answer is yes, but they have specific requirements that must be met. And much depends on your fare class or loyalty perks level. When booking a ticket, the lowest cost fare is called Basic Blue. If you have a short trip or don't need to pack much, this option allows you a personal item but no carry-on. Increased fares come with several other perks including no fees for bringing a carry-on. Of course, if you fly with Jet Blue often, you can sign up for their loyalty program. This program, called Mosaic, offers even more perks to its members and may include free carry-ons, reduced rates, premier boarding, and more.

Jet Blue Carry-on Bag Size Whether you get to carry on as part of your fare class, a perk for being a loyalty member, or paying a fee, all carry-ons must meet the Jet Blue carry-on size limit. These limitations arenâ€™t arbitrary or intended to make life difficult. Theyâ€™re based on how big the overhead storage compartments are in the aircraft. Including wheels and handles, carry-on luggage for Jet Blue cannot exceed 22 x 14 x 9 â€“ that is, 22 inches long, 14 inches wide, and 9 inches deep. These are in line with standard size limits for most domestic airlines. Jet Blue Carry-On Weight Limit Airlines limit the size of your carry-on so it can easily fit into the overhead space and still allow plenty of room for luggage from other passengers. Most international airlines also limit the weight of your carry-on item. Limiting the weight helps ensure that the plane is properly balanced, and it can easily be estimated what the final weight will be at take-off if the plane is full. International flights have carry-on weight limits that range from less than 15 pounds to 50 pounds. Jet Blueâ€™s carry-on policy indicates no specific weight limit for carry-on luggage. However, you must be able to lift it to place it in the overhead bin. Personal items and Jet Blue Every passenger that flies with Jet Blue is allowed to bring a personal item. These items are commonly purses, laptop bags, or small backpacks and must fit under the seat in front of you. This policy allows you to have onboard access to important items like medication, books, electronics, documents, and more. There is no weight limit for your under-the-seat personal item; however, it must not exceed 17 x 13 x 8 â€“ that is 17 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 8 inches high. Infants and Jet Blue Carry-On Policy Travel is one of the best ways to expose children to the wonders of the world. Of course, kids come with a lot of baggageâ€¦ literally. Jet Blueâ€™s infant baggage policies are in line with other major airlines, briefly summarized here: Children up to 2 years old can sit on parent's lap. Diaper bags are allowed in addition to personal items and carry-ons. Breast pumps are considered assistive devices, and do not count as carry-on baggage. Car sets and strollers can be checked at no charge. Children under age two can fly free if they sit in your lap. However, if they will occupy a seat, you will have to buy them their own ticket. The number of personal items and space for storing them are limited to the number of seats you purchase. Medical Assistive Devices and Service Animals The Jet Blue carry-on policy has exclusions for medical devices and service animals. These devices do not count toward the personal item or carry-on limit, but they must follow the size and weight guidelines. Therefore, any device over the size or weight limit for a carry-on may need to be checked. Medical assistive items include: Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POC) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machines (CPAP) Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) Breast Pumps Catheter Hearing Aids Inhalers Insulin Pumps Pacemakers Respirators Ventilators Jet Blue allows trained service dogs only. When booking your ticket, you must notify the airline and provide official documentation for the animal upon arrival. If the dog is too big to fit within the footprint of the seat purchased (it cannot be in the aisle), then an additional seat must be purchased. It is recommended to contact the airline before booking a flight if you plan to travel with a service animal. Choosing a Carry-On Bag for Jet Blue The carry-on guidelines for Jet Blue are pretty straightforward. If you book the basic fare, one that includes no frills, you get the lowest price available, but you don't have access to the overhead bins. Booking a different fare class, or joining the loyalty program, can allow access to bring carry-ons and more. As mentioned, carry-on guidelines vary by airline. You can read about your chosen airline and what they allow inÂ our airline resource guides page.
