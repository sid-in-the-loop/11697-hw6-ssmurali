It's important to ensure it's the right size to be stored in the overhead bin or fit under the seat in front of you without issues. While most domestic and international airlines publish their accepted measurements for carry-on luggage, some luggage makers produce bags labeled ‚Äúcarry-on baggage‚Äù that exceed those size restrictions. You don't want to arrive at the airport with your luggage packed only to find out that your bag is too big and has to be checked. That‚Äôs why Travelpro¬Æ goes the extra mile to test our spinners, carry-on luggage and bags with real-world sizer bins used by airlines worldwide. RELATED: Find your perfect bag with our luggage finder quiz. We make it easy and stress-free for you to shop for a bag that won't exceed size limits for in-cabin luggage by indicating which products have been Sizer Bin Tested under FEATURES on our product pages. We also provide detailed information on the size and weight of our and checked luggage. What¬†Size is a¬†Carry-on Anyway? When airlines refer to your "carry-on bag," they are referring to smaller suitcases, duffel bags, and weekenders that fit in the overhead bin space onboard. "Personal items," in airline industry terminology, are small enough to fit under the airplane seat, like travel totes and purses, laptop bags, diaper bags, and briefcases or backpacks.¬† These differences may seem subtle, but there are limitations regarding both personal items and carry-on luggage. Check out¬†our guide to personal items, and see major airlines' restrictions on these under-the-seat bags. Maximum Carry-On Size Your max carry-on size depends on whether your bag will fit in the overhead bin. Most bins can only handle carry-on luggage that is 22 inches tall, including wheels. Larger than that, and the bag would have to be turned sideways, which takes up too much room. Domestic Carry-On Size Domestic flights generally offer a little bit more space than international flights. Few domestic airlines put a weight limit on your carry-on luggage as well. TSA typically does not look at your carry-on size but there are a few established TSA guidelines for liquids and other items you pack in your carry on. International Carry-On Size International flights tend to be a little stricter with their sizes. Most will weigh your carry-on before you board. If it is overweight, you could be charged a fee. Get specific rules and recommendations oncarry on size for international flights with our guide. Carry-on Size Per Airlines The answer to, ‚ÄúWhat size is a carry-on suitcase?‚Äù, depends on whether you're flying domestically or internationally. Standard, domestic, carry-on luggage size is currently limited to around 22 inches tall, 9 inches deep, and 14 inches wide. A few airlines allow larger bags to be carried on. If flying internationally, plan to pack lighter or check your bag. Published carry-on size limits for international airlines range between 15.7-22 inches tall with varying widths and depths. Our handy chart below compares carry-on size limits by airline. .

Carry on Luggage Weight While all domestic airlines have weight limits for checked luggage, most don't publish weight restrictions for carry-on bags. International airlines post weight limits ranging from 15 to 26 lbs., but it's doubtful that your carry-on will be weighed. Just be sure you can lift it over your head to place it in the overhead bin unassisted.For safety reasons, airlines operating smaller aircraft, like commuter planes, adhere to strict weight limits for baggage you bring onboard. In fact, many of these planes don't have overhead bins at all, so smaller personal items are all you can bring into the cabin. Everything else will be stowed as checked luggage.When carrying on and toting bags through endless terminals or city streets, choose lighter-weight luggage. Travelpro¬Æ makes several styles of lightweight luggage that are just as durable as heavier bags. Our Maxlite¬Æ 5 Expandable Carry-on Spinner, for example, weighs only 5.4 lbs., so you can pack what you need and still keep it light. Read more about lightweight, highly-durable luggage here. Carry On Luggage Size Matters You can also find baggage sizer bins at the airport. Baggage sizers are essentially ‚Äúcubbies‚Äù built to the airline‚Äôs carry-on size restrictions. Because these sizer bins and requirements vary by airline, you can usually find them near the airline‚Äôs ticket counter and at the gate. When measuring your bag's height, include the wheels and the handle, and don't forget about the depth. Your carry-on luggage needs to fit within all size limits. Travelpro¬Æ makes elite expandable luggage¬†that increases packing capacity when needed, which can be quite helpful when shopping on your trip. Just don't pack your suitcase until it bulges, and avoid cramming too much in the front pockets if your bag has them. Overpacking risks making your bag too fat to fit in the overhead bin. TIP:¬†Hard shell luggage¬†doesn‚Äôt stretch like soft-sided bags, so if you are worried about your bag's girth or tend to overstuff your luggage, a hard-sided carry-on may be a better choice than a soft-sided carry-on made from flexible fabric. Knowing the carry-on size for airlines first means you can find the perfect bag before you head out. Check out our blogs on¬† and Hard Shell vs. Softside Luggage. Happy travels!
