These Conditions of Carriage apply to such flights that bear the airline code “LH” on the flight\nticket.\nCode share\n2.2. We have concluded agreements with other airlines that are known as “code shares”. This\nmeans that another airline may operate a flight, even when Lufthansa (LH) is indicated as the\ncarrier in the carrier box of the ticket. In the event of a code share flight, Lufthansa will advise you\nof the carrier operating the flight when you make your booking.\nFor code share services on flights operated by other carriers, these Conditions of Carriage shall\napply.\nIn the event that the flight is operated by a different carrier, you should familiarise yourself with\nthe special characteristics, e.g. check-in times, provisions regarding the re-confirmation of\nbookings, requirements and policies regarding the carriage of unaccompanied minors, carriage of\nanimals, refusal of carriage, oxygen devices, operational irregularities, denied-boarding\ncompensation and free baggage allowance/acceptance, etc. of the carrier operating the flight.\nInformation about Lufthansa’s code share partners is available on our website lufthansa.com.\nArticle 3: Tickets\nGeneral\n3.1.\n3.1.1.

The airfare will thereby be determined in accordance with the fare you would have had to\npay for your actual routing in your price group on the day of your booking. This fare may be higher\nor lower than the fare you originally paid.\nIf the price group you originally booked was not available for the altered routing on the day of the\nbooking, the cheapest available former price group for your altered routing will be taken as the\nbasis for the recalculation.\nIf, on the day of the booking for your altered routing, a higher fare would have been determined,\nwe will subsequently collect the difference taking into account the fare already paid.

This does not apply if your travel plans simply change or if you are prevented, due to\nforce majeure, illness or for another reason for which you are not responsible, from commencing\ncarriage on all legs, or on individual legs in the order indicated on the flight ticket. Whenever\npossible, kindly notify us of the reasons for such changes as soon as you become aware of them.\nIn the event of a recalculation, the airfare determined will be based on the fare you would have\nhad to pay for your actual routing in your price group on the day of your booking.

Transport is subject to the liability order of the Agreement of Montreal of 28 March 1999\n(“Montreal Convention”), which was implemented in the European Community by Regulation (EC)\nNo. 2027/97 in the version amended by Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002 and the national\nlegislation of the member states.\n14.1.2. If the injured party has contributed to causing the damage which has arisen, the norms of\nthe applicable national law in terms of the exclusion or the reduction of the liability to pay\ndamages with contributive fault of the injured party apply.\n14.1.3. Law action in court for compensation pursuant to the Montreal Convention must be filed\nwithin two years, starting with the date of arrival of the aircraft, or the day on which the aircraft\nshould have arrived, or on which the carriage was interrupted.\n14.1.4. We are not liable for damages that arise from our fulfilment of state regulations or that\narise due to your failure to fulfil your obligations.\n14.1.5. Under no circumstances will our liability exceed the amount of the damage documented.\nWe are only liable for indirect or consequential damage if we or our personnel have caused it in a\ngrossly negligent or wilful manner. This does not apply to personal injury.\n14.1.6. The exclusions from liability and the liability restrictions of the Montreal Convention and\nof the respectively applicable national law shall apply, unless otherwise explicitly stipulated by\nthese Conditions of Carriage.\nCompensation in the event of death or injury\n14.2.\n14.2.1. There are no maximum compensation amounts for liability in the event of the death or\nLUFTHANSA 14/17\ninjury of passengers. For damage of up to SDR 128,821 (approx. EUR 150,000), the carrier shall\nnot be able to contest claims for damages with reference to fault. Receivables that exceed this\namount can only be averted by the carrier by the latter proving that both it itself and its people\ndid not act in a negligent or otherwise culpable manner, and that no negligent or otherwise\nculpable omission is the cause.\nAdvance payments\n14.2.2. If a passenger is killed or injured, the carrier must make an advance payment within 15\ndays of the identification of the person entitled to damage, in order to cover their immediate\neconomic needs. In the event of death, the advance payment is no less than SDR 16,000 (approx.\nEUR 19,000).\nDamage to or loss or destruction of baggage\n14.3.\n14.3.1. In the case of checked baggage pursuant to Art. 8.6 of these Conditions of Carriage, a\nculpability-independent liability exists unless the baggage was already damaged beforehand.\nWith non-checked baggage, we are only liable for our culpable behaviour and that of our\npersonnel.\nLiability limits for baggage\n14.3.2. We are liable for damage to or loss or destruction of baggage up to SDR 1,288 (approx.\nEUR 1,500). A higher liability limit applies if the passenger submits a special declaration regarding\nthe amount-based interest in the delivery of the checked baggage at the destination at the latest\nupon check-in and pays the requested surcharge. In this case, the agreed amount is deemed to be\nthe liability limit if the carrier cannot prove that the agreed amount is higher than the actual\ninterest of the passenger in the delivery of the checked baggage at the destination.\nComplaints with regard to baggage\n14.3.3. If you accept the baggage delivered to you unconditionally, we take for granted, as long\nas the opposite is not proven, that it was delivered to you in good condition and according to the\ncontract of carriage. In the event of damage to or loss or destruction of baggage, the passenger\nmust request compensation from the airline as soon as possible in writing or in text format. In the\nevent of damage to baggage, all legal action is excluded if the entitled party does not notify the\ncarrier immediately after the damage is discovered, but in the case of checked baggage, no later\nthan seven days after the acceptance of the baggage. This does not apply if the carrier has acted\nin a fraudulent manner.\n14.3.4. We are not liable for damages caused by items in your baggage, unless it is due to gross\nnegligence or an intentional act on our part. If these items cause damage to the baggage of other\npassengers or to our property, you are obliged to compensate us for all damages and expenses\nresulting therefrom.\nDelays in the carriage of passengers and baggage\n14.4.\n14.4.1. We are liable for damages due to delays during the carriage of passengers and in the\ncarriage of checked baggage, unless we and our personnel took all reasonable measures to\nprevent the damages, or if taking these measures was not possible for us or our personnel.\nLUFTHANSA 15/17\nLiability limits for damages arising from delays\n14.4.2.

A higher liability limit applies if the passenger submits a special\ndeclaration regarding the amount-based interest in the delivery of the checked baggage at the\nplace of destination and pays the required surcharge at the latest upon check-in. In this case, the\nagreed amount is deemed to be the liability limit if the carrier cannot prove that the agreed\namount is higher than the actual interest of the passenger in the delivery of the checked baggage\nat the place of destination.\nComplaints with regard to baggage\n14.4.4. In the case of damage that has been caused by the delayed delivery of baggage, the\npassenger must notify the carrier as quickly as possible in writing or in text form. In the event of\ndamage due to delays, all legal action is excluded if the entitled party does not give notification of\nthe damage within 21 days after the delivery of the baggage. This does not apply if the carrier has\nacted in a fraudulent manner.\nCo-culpability of the passenger\n14.4.5. If the injured party has contributed to causing the damage which has arisen, the amount\nof the compensation claim is to be reduced in proportion to the contributory negligence of said\nparty. In particular, the injured party is obliged not to increase the compensation amount caused\nby the loss or delayed carriage of his/her baggage through unreasonable replacement purchases.\nArticle 15: Headings\nThe headings in these Conditions of Carriage are only for transparency and are not relevant for\ninterpretation or for making claims for damages.\nArticle 16: Other conditions\nCarriage is subject to certain additional regulations and conditions that apply to our\ncircumstances, or are published by us.
