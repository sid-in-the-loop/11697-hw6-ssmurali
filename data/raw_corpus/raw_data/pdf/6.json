Under the\nfinal rule, U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents must clearly disclose passenger-\nspecific or itinerary-specific fees for these services to consumers whenever fare and schedule\ninformation is provided for flights to, within, and from the United States. The Department is\nfurther requiring that carriers provide useable, current, and accurate information regarding fees\nfor these critical ancillary services to any entity that is required to disclose critical ancillary\nservice fee information to consumers. This final rule is in response to the Executive order on\nPromoting Competition in the American Economy, which directs the Department to take various\nactions to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers. The rule will\nensure that consumers have the information they need to understand the true costs of air\ntransportation that apply to them, which will create a more competitive market with better\noutcomes for consumers.\nDATES: This rule becomes effective on [INSERT DATE 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF\nPUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Heather Filemyr, Ryan Patanaphan, or Blane\nA.

Executive Summary\n(1) Purpose of the Regulatory Action\nThe purpose of this final rule is to ensure that consumers know upfront the fees carriers\ncharge for transporting a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag and for\ncanceling or changing a reservation to avoid surprise fees that can add up quickly and add\nsignificant cost to what may, at first, look like a cheap ticket. Airlines1 have imposed separate\nfees for ancillary services related to air travel beyond passenger air transportation as part of their\nbusiness model for many years.2 Ancillary service fees are not subject to the 7.5% airline ticket\ntax that is used to support the Aviation Trust Fund. These ancillary fees have become more\ncomplex over time and continue to confuse consumers, as explained in section B (2). Which\nairlines impose such fees, what services require payment of a fee, the amount of the fee, and\nwhether the same fees apply to all passengers are in a continuous state of change. For example,\nduring the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) public health emergency, several airlines advertised the\nelimination of ticket change fees, but despite these general announcements, airlines continued to\n1 The preamble in this final rule uses the term “airlines” to refer to “air carriers” and “foreign air carriers” as those\nterms are used in the Department’s regulations. The two terms are defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(2) and (a)(21).\n2 See, e.g., Comment from the International Air Transport Association, p.4 (“Airlines have been separating baggage\nfees from the core transportation service for more than 14 years . . . .”), available at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0085.\nimpose, or later reimposed, change fees for certain fare types such as “basic economy.”3 In this\ncontext, consumer organizations have long advocated for more upfront disclosure of ancillary\nfees.4\nOn July 9, 2021, the President issued E.O. 14036, “Promoting Competition in the\nAmerican Economy,”5 which launched a whole-of-government approach to strengthen\ncompetition across many sectors, including commercial aviation. Section 5, paragraph (m)(i)(F)\nof E.O. 14036 directed the Department to “consider initiating a rulemaking to ensure that\nconsumers have ancillary fee information, including ‘baggage fees,’ ‘change fees,’ and\n‘cancellation fees,’ at the time of ticket purchase.” This rulemaking responds to the direction in\nE.O. 14036 to provide improved ancillary fee disclosures to consumers purchasing air\ntransportation.6\n(2) Overview of Existing Requirements\nIn 2011, the Department issued a final rule titled, “Enhancing Airline Passenger\nProtections,”7 that sought to address consumer concerns regarding the proliferation of ancillary\nfees. In the rule, the Department added several disclosure requirements for airlines: (1) a\ndisclosure on the homepage for at least three months of any increase in the fee for passenger\nbaggage or any change in the free baggage allowance for checked or carry-on baggage; (2) a\n3 See, e.g., Delta Air Lines, Delta Eliminates Change Fees, Building On Commitment to Flexibility for Consumers,\nAug. 31, 2020, Alaska Airlines, Fly with Peace of Mind: Alaska Airlines Eliminates Change Fees Permanently,\nSept. 1, 2020, American Airlines, Wave Goodbye to Change Fees, Spirit Airlines, How Can I Change or Cancel My\nReservation?

See also Final Rule, Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, 76 FR 23110,\n23142 (Apr. 25, 2011).\n5 86 FR 36987 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/14/2021-15069/promoting-competition-in-the-\namerican-economy).\n6 This rulemaking also addresses section 5, paragraph (m)(i)(B) of E.O.14036. That section directed the Department\nto promote enhanced transparency and consumer safeguards, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,\nincluding through potential rulemaking, enforcement actions, or guidance documents, with the aims of enhancing\nconsumer access to airline flight information so that consumers can more easily find a broader set of available\nflights, including by new or lesser known airlines; and ensuring that consumers are not exposed or subject to\nadvertising, marketing, pricing, and charging of ancillary fees that may constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or\nan unfair method of competition.\n7 76 FR 23110, supra.\nnotice on the first screen with a fare disclosure that additional airline fees for baggage may apply\nand where consumers can go to access these baggage fees; (3) a notice on e-ticket confirmations\nregarding the free baggage allowance for that flight and any applicable fee for the first and\nsecond checked bag and carry-on bag; and (4) a disclosure of all fees for optional services in one\ncentral place on the seller’s website, with non-baggage fees permitted to be expressed as ranges.\nUnder the 2011 rule, the Department determined that checked and carry-on baggage were\n“fundamental” to air travel, and the Department required that fees for such services be expressed\nas specific charges on a central place on the airline’s website (alongside other ancillary fees),\nwith information about any differing prices and allowances based on the passenger’s status.\nBased on ticket agent concerns that the rule would be costly to ticket agents as airlines are\n“updating and changing fees constantly,”8 the Department applied fewer or modified disclosure\nrequirements to ticket agents.\nBased on continued feedback by various stakeholders and advisory committees (further\ndiscussed below), the Department explored further changes to ancillary fee disclosure\nrequirements in a 2014 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)9 and a 2017 supplemental notice\nof proposed rulemaking (SNPRM)10. These efforts are further described in section B below,\nthough neither resulted in changes to the regulation.\n(3) Summary of Major Provisions\nThis final rule increases the protections provided to consumers as set forth in the\nsummary table below.\nSubject Requirement\nCovered Entities The final rule applies to U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents\n(excluding corporate travel agents) that advertise or sell air transportation\ndirectly to consumers.\n8 Id. at 23145.\n9 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014).\n10 82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017).\nThe Department defers for a later rulemaking the determination of whether\nmetasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search\noptions directly to consumers are ticket agents that must disclose ancillary fee\ninformation required by this rule.\nCritical Ancillary The rule defines critical ancillary services as any ancillary service critical to\nServices consumers’ purchasing decisions. The ancillary services that this final rule\nidentifies as critical to consumers are as follows: (1) transporting a first\nchecked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag; and (2) changing or\ncanceling a reservation.\nAny other service may also be determined, after notice and opportunity to\ncomment, to be critical by the Secretary.\nDisclosure of Fees and The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose fees for critical\nPolicies for Critical ancillary services during the itinerary search process at the first point where a\nAncillary Services fare and schedule is provided in connection with a specific flight itinerary.\nThe fee disclosure includes noting that a fare category does not allow\nchanging or canceling a reservation or transporting a checked or carry-on bag\nif that is the case.\nPolicies for critical ancillary services must be disclosed before ticket purchase\nwhen a search is conducted online but are not required to be disclosed with\nthe fare and schedule.\nThe information disclosed must be accurate, clear, and conspicuous. Fees\ncannot be displayed through a hyperlink, but disclosure is permitted using\npop-ups, expandable text, or other means.\nLinks to Book a Flight This final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that sell airline tickets to\nwith a Carrier or an disclose critical ancillary service fees on the first page of their online\nOnline Travel Agency platforms to which consumers are directed after searching for flight options\n(OTA) on another entity’s online platform (a metasearch site) unless the consumer\nwas already provided accurate fee information on the directing entity’s online\nplatform.\nPassenger-Specific This final rule requires carriers and ticket agents to disclose the fees for\nand Anonymous critical ancillary services as passenger-specific itinerary information if a\nSearches consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search.\nA passenger-specific itinerary search refers to a search that takes into account\ninformation specific to the passenger (e.g., the passenger’s status in the\nairline’s frequent flyer program, the passenger’s military status, or the\npassenger’s status as a holder of a particular credit card) that was\naffirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the\nitinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class\nsuch as full fare ticket) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be\ncharged or policies to be applied.\nAn anonymous itinerary search refers to a search that does not take into\naccount information specific to the passenger but does take into account\ninformation specific to the itinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class,\nand ticketed fare class such as full fare ticket) that may impact the critical\nancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied.\nOpting Out of The final rule does not permit airlines and ticket agents to omit disclosure of\nDisclosures first checked, second checked, or carry-on baggage fees with the fare and\nschedule information on their online platform unless: (1) the airline/ticket\nagent asks consumers at the beginning of a search if they intend to travel with\na carry-on bag or checked bags; and (2) a consumer affirmatively indicates\nthat no one in the booking party intends to travel with carry-on bag or first or\nsecond checked bags.\nThe final rule does not permit airlines or ticket agents to enable consumers to\nopt out of display of change and cancellation fees on the airline’s or ticket\nagent’s online platform.\nDisclosures on Online The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees and\nPlatforms policies for critical ancillary services on airlines’ or ticket agents’ online\nplatforms.\nThe final rule defines “online platforms” to be any interactive electronic\nmedium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that\nallow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S.\ncarrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent.\nOffline (Telephone, The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose to consumers\nIn-person) Disclosures during an in-person or telephone inquiry that critical ancillary fees apply if\nof Airline Ancillary that is the case and upon request disclose those fees to consumers.\nService Fees\nSharing of Airline This final rule requires airlines to provide critical ancillary fee information to\nAncillary Service Fee any entity that is required to disclose critical ancillary service fee information\nInformation to consumers.\nPercentage-Off The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that advertise percentage-off\nAdvertisements discounts of a “flight,” “ticket,” or “fare” to apply the percentage-off discount\nto the full fare (i.e., all mandatory government taxes/fees and carrier-imposed\ncharges/fees).\nThe final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that advertise percentage-off\ndiscounts of a “base fare” to apply the percentage-off discount to the full fare\namount excluding all government taxes and charges (i.e., all mandatory\ncarrier-imposed charges/fees).\nCompliance/ The final rule requires that: (1) airlines must provide required critical\nImplementation Period ancillary fee data to ticket agents not later than six months after this rule’s\npublication date, or October 30, 2024; (2) airlines must comply with all other\nregulatory requirements no later than 12 months after this rule’s publication\ndate, or April 30, 2025; (3) ticket agents that do not meet the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) definition of small entity must comply with all\nregulatory requirements no later than 18 months after this rule’s publication\ndate, or October 30, 2025; and (4) ticket agents that that meet the SBA\ndefinition of small entity must comply with all regulatory requirements no\nlater than 24 months after this rule’s publication date, or April 30, 2026.\n(4) Costs and Benefits\nThe final rule changes how U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents\ndisclose information about certain ancillary fees for flights. Expected benefits of the rule result\nfrom the reduction of excess consumption of air travel, or deadweight loss, which occurs because\nconsumers who are unaware of ancillary service fees behave as if the price for air travel is lower\nthan it is. Annual benefits from reducing deadweight loss are expected to amount to $5.5 million.\nThe other source of benefits estimated by the Department is from the time consumers will save\nwhen they search for airfare because they no longer need to interrupt their search to find\ninformation on ancillary service fees. Depending on assumptions regarding the number of\nconsumers who consider ancillary fee information when they search for airfare, time savings\nbenefits are expected to range from $365 million to $484 million annually.\nExpected costs of this rule include costs to consumers due to the time needed to navigate\nincreased amounts of information, which range from $239 million to $331 million annually. The\nprimary estimated costs of the rule to carriers and ticket agents are the costs that they would\nincur to modify their websites by adjusting their displays of fares, schedules, and fees. Third\nparties involved in data exchange, such as Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) and direct-\nchannel companies might incur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though the\nDepartment acknowledges that these entities are already upgrading systems for market reasons\nand have been for several years. Quantified costs range from $286 million to $378 million\nannually.\nOne effect of better information on ancillary fees is that some consumers will pay less for\nthe ancillary services they use when they travel by air. These economic effects are not societal\nbenefits or costs but represent a transfer from airlines to consumers, estimated to be about $543\nmillion annually. This transfer represents $543 million in overpayment in fees for consumers, or\nfrom the perspective of airlines, additional revenue from consumers who are surprised by fees\nand, for example, then need to pay a higher fee at the airport to check a bag. This transfer, as\nwell as the benefits due to any reduction in deadweight loss, accrue to consumers and are\nexpected to occur regardless of any time savings impacts.\nB. Background\n(1) Existing Ancillary Fee Disclosure Requirements\nAs noted above, the Department’s existing regulations in 14 CFR 399.85 contain the\nrequirements for ancillary fee disclosures as promulgated in the 2011 final rule. Under 14 CFR\n399.85(a), airlines must promptly and prominently disclose any increase in fees for a carry-on or\nfirst and second checked bags and any change in bag allowances on the homepages of their\nwebsites. Paragraph (b) requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose clearly and prominently on\nthe first screen with a fare quotation for a specific itinerary that additional airline fees for\nbaggage may apply and where consumers can see these fees. Ticket agents may refer consumers\nto the airline websites for specific baggage fee information or to their own sites if they display\nairline baggage fees. Paragraph (c) requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose on e-ticket\nconfirmations information regarding passengers’ free baggage allowances and applicable fees for\na carry-on bag and a first and second checked bag, expressed as specific charges taking into\naccount any factors that affect those charges such as passenger status. Paragraph (d) requires\nairlines to disclose the fees for all ancillary services on their websites, accessible through a\nconspicuous link from the carrier’s homepage. The paragraph notes that such fees may generally\nbe expressed as a range, but baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into\naccount any factors that affect those charges.\nRequirements in other regulations also have an impact on ancillary fees. Under 14 CFR\n253.7, airlines may not impose any terms restricting refunds of the ticket price, charging\nmonetary penalties on passengers, or raising the ticket price, unless the passenger receives\nconspicuous written notice of the salient features of those terms on or with the ticket. In 14 CFR\n399.88, sellers of scheduled air transportation may not increase the price of passenger baggage\nafter the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer. As stated in the NPRM for this\nrulemaking, while the text of 14 CFR 399.88 references ancillary fees such as seat fees, the\nDepartment announced in 2011 that it would enforce the prohibition on post-purchase price\nincreases only for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags.11\n(2) Problems with Existing Requirements and Efforts to Improve Disclosures\nFollowing the 2011 final rule, described above, the Department issued an NPRM titled\n“Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues” in\n2014.12 The 2014 rulemaking contained various proposals to enhance consumer protections,\nincluding a proposal to require the disclosure of certain airline ancillary service fees (i.e., first\nchecked bag, second checked bag, one carry-on item, and advance seat selection) to consumers\nthrough all sales channels on the first page on which a fare is displayed in response to a specific\nflight itinerary search request. The proposal to require disclosure of certain ancillary fees was\nbased in part on a recommendation by the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee (FAAC).13\nThe FAAC’s 2010 report had noted that, despite improvements in the air consumer experience,\nFAAC members felt that consumers sought greater transparency in the total cost of their tickets\nand that they should have the ability to choose between carriers that either do not charge for\ncertain services or charge differing fees. The 2014 NPRM also relied on the statements of a\nsuccessor committee, the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection (ACACP),\nwhich in 2012 adopted the FAAC recommendation and added that all participants in the airfare\n11 See also Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket\n(December 28, 2011). The application of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was at issue in a lawsuit\nfiled by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the December 28, 2011,\nguidance and upheld the Department's rule prohibiting post-purchase price increases as it is currently being applied.\nSpirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20-21. Petition for Writ of\nCertiorari denied on April 1, 2013.\n12 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014).\n13 See Recommendation 11, in FAAC Final Report (2010), available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/highlights/future-aviation-advisory-committee/faac-final-report.\nand fee distribution system should be guided by principles of transparency, providing choices\nand offers that meet consumer needs, and knowing the full price before purchase.14 While the\nACACP commended the Department’s regulatory efforts to add transparency, it noted that the\naviation industry offered a variety of business models, network choices, and optional services,\nand that the level of choice was creating complexity for consumers. The ACACP had heard from\nadvocates and ticket agents that consumers expect to know the cost of the entire trip before\npurchasing a ticket.15\nIn issuing the 2014 proposal on disclosure of certain airline ancillary service fees, the\nDepartment explained that the proposal was necessary because the 2011 rule, while a step in the\nright direction, did not fully address the problem of lack of transparency of ancillary services and\nproducts. The 2014 proposal on disclosure of airline ancillary service fees generated significant\ncomments from consumers, airlines, ticket agents, and other interested parties. During the\npendency of the 2014 rulemaking, the ACACP recommended that DOT require that change and\ncancellation fees be clear and displayed before ticket purchase.16 Consumer advocates had\nasserted at an ACACP meeting held on June 23, 2015, that such fees had become significant and\ndifficult to ascertain.17 At that time, the ACACP also discussed baggage fees and allowances,\nwith consumer advocates noting that baggage allowance rules were confusing to consumers and\nthat it was difficult for consumers to understand which airline’s rules apply. At the same\nmeeting, a ticket agent representative stated that every baggage fee scheme had “multiple layers\nand exceptions” that were not always dynamically available to ticket agents.18\n14 Report of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 7–8 (Oct. 22, 2012), available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/1st-ACACP-Report-22OCT2012.\n15 Id., see, e.g., Transcript - Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection, First Meeting, June 28, 2012,\navailable at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2012-0087-0095.\n16 Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3 (Sept. 1,\n2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/9th-meeting-Sept-1/record.\n17 See Record of Meeting, Eighth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3–5 (June\n23, 2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/resources/individuals/aviation-\nconsumer-protection/285976/acacp-record-8th-meeting-23june2015.pdf; see also Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting\nof the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection (Sept. 1, 2015).\n18 Id.\nIn 2016, the Department decided not to issue a final rule on the issue of transparency of\nairline ancillary services given the complexity of the issues and additional considerations\nidentified by comments submitted on the 2014 NPRM. Instead, the Department decided to seek\nadditional information on the disclosure of fees for ancillary services in a supplemental\nrulemaking.19 In January 2017, the Department issued an SNPRM, which focused solely on the\nissue of transparency of certain ancillary service fees.20 In the 2017 SNPRM, the Department\nproposed to require fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag to be disclosed at\nall points of sale wherever fare and schedule information is provided to consumers. While the\nSNPRM was pending, in September 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)\nnoted that consumer group representatives stated that it had become “increasingly difficult for\nconsumers to compare airfare ticket prices, fees, and associated rules, and understand what is\nincluded in their purchases.”21 On December 14, 2017, the SNPRM was withdrawn with the\nDepartment noting that the withdrawal is consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13771,\nReducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.22 After the withdrawal, a number of\nState attorneys general urged the Department to reverse its decision, stating that they “regularly\nhear reports from consumers in [their] states who are confused and frustrated by these fees,\nwhich significantly alter the total cost of travel.”23 E.O. 13771 was later revoked.24\nWhile the disclosure regulations promulgated in 2011 remain in place, consumer\nadvocates continue to express concerns to the Department that there is a market failure in air\n19 In 2016, the Department issued a final rule that promulgated regulations related to carrier reporting, disclosure of\ncodeshare operations, and display bias, while separating out the ancillary fee disclosure and ticket agent definition\nissues into separate rulemaking efforts. 81 FR 76800 (Nov. 3, 2016).

They have also raised concerns that consumers often find the process of\ndetermining the baggage fees that apply to them to be a complicated and time-consuming\nprocess. Consumer advocates have asserted that a lack of passenger-specific information\nregarding fees for ancillary services at the time of ticket purchase is causing a market failure by\nlimiting the ability of consumers to understand the true cost of the travel they are looking to\npurchase and compare pricing between carriers and travel options. Consumer advocates have\nalso noted a significant increase in the number of ancillary service fees imposed by carriers.\nCertain members of Congress have expressed support for full, more specific, disclosure\nof ancillary service fees. Members of Congress have also sponsored legislation on this topic.25\nFurther, the Joint Explanatory Statement of the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act requested\nthat the Department work in collaboration with industry, consumers, and other stakeholders to\nestablish guidelines on transparency of airline ancillary fees.26 Subsequently, the Department\ntasked the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) with examining this\nissue again.27\nIn 2019, during a meeting of the ACPAC, two consumer organizations underscored the\ndifficulties faced by consumers in determining the total cost of air travel.28 Consumer advocates\nmaintained that consumers were confused by the complex charts that carriers and ticket agents\nprovide to consumers to determine their baggage fees. The ACPAC heard from several consumer\n25 See, e.g., Letter from Representative Nita M. Lowey to Secretary Elaine Chao (Dec. 8, 2017).

Consumer organizations that\npresented to the ACPAC stressed the importance of ensuring consumers can accurately and\neasily compare travel costs, inclusive of ancillary fees, and they recommended that ancillary fee\ninformation should be clearly displayed early in consumer purchase decisions.29\nIn December 2020, the ACPAC submitted a report to the Department recommending that\nthe Department remain vigilant to ensure compliance with the existing transparency\nrequirements. The ACPAC was silent on whether the Department should issue a new rulemaking\non transparency of airline ancillary fees.30 In July 2021, E.O. 14036 directed the Department to\nconsider initiating a rulemaking to ensure consumers have ancillary fee information at the time\nof ticket purchase.\nBased on E.O. 14036 and the above-described history of concerns raised by consumer\norganizations and individual consumers, including the individual complaints the Department has\nreceived reflecting the confusion consumers experience regarding ancillary fees,31 the\nDepartment determined that this rulemaking is necessary to address ongoing inadequacies in\nexisting ancillary fee disclosure requirements. It appears that consumers are generally unaware\nof the amount of the ancillary fees that apply to them when they book tickets. Consumer\nadvocates contend that the ancillary services and fees that airlines currently post on their\nwebsites are not sufficiently useful to consumers to determine the cost of travel because airlines\ngenerally provide a range of fees for ancillary services aside from baggage. Airlines\nacknowledge that the fees for ancillary services often vary based on various factors such as the\n29 See Summary of April 4, 2019 ACPAC Meeting 10–16, available at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0019; see also Summary of September 24, 2020\nACPAC Meeting 19–20, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0025.\n30 Report of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee 5 (Dec. 31, 2020), available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/acpac-report-secretary-transportation-\ndecember-31-2020.\n31 See, e.g., https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0021,\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0022, and\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0023.\ntype of aircraft used, the flight on which a passenger is booked, or the time at which a passenger\npays for the service or product. Regarding baggage fees, consumer advocacy organizations have\nreported to the Department that consumers often find the process of determining the baggage\nfees that apply to them to be a complicated and time-consuming process. Consumer advocates\nalso expressed the view that because most passengers travel once per year or less, they may not\nbe aware of certain ancillary service fees.32 Advocates further argued that the practice of drip\npricing, a pricing technique in which firms advertise only part of the price and reveal other\ncharges later as the customer goes through the buying process, tends to lock consumers into\nengaging with a given seller, and reduces competition, because the customer has invested time\nand energy into the purchasing process and thus is less likely to abandon the purchase entirely\nand re-institute a fuller search for options.33\nFollowing the issuance of E.O. 14036, the ACPAC met again in June 2022 to address the\nissue of transparency of airline ancillary service fees.34 During the meeting, DOT solicited\ncomment on topics being considered for the NPRM on ancillary fee transparency. These topics\nincluded identifying ancillary service fees critical to consumers, the sharing of airline data\nregarding critical ancillary service fees with ticket agents, and how to best display this\ninformation to consumers. DOT also solicited comment on whether fees for certain ancillary\nservices should be disclosed at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed. At the\nmeeting, a consumer advocate stated that consumers still do not know the specific amounts of\nbaggage and change and cancellation fees that apply during the ticket purchase process.35\n32 Presentation of FlyersRights.org (FlyersRights), available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-\n2018-0190-0046.\n33 Id.; see also Presentation of American Antitrust Institute, available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 morning session), and\nFederal Trade Commission, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HOTEL RESORT FEES, (Jan. 2017), available at\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/economic-analysis-hotel-resort-\nfees/p115503_hotel_resort_fees_economic_issues_paper.pdf.\n34 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting.

On the second day of the meeting, the ACPAC\naddressed the separate but related issue of availability of airline flight information.\n35 Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) June 28 and 29, 2022 Meeting Minutes 8,\navailable at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0073.\nAnother consumer advocate expressed concerns with drip pricing.36 The advocate also stated that\nbaggage fees vary by airline and can depend on the flight, the time, and the day. A representative\nof the American Antitrust Institute stated that cancellation fees were discontinued at the\nbeginning of the pandemic and then returned, and that drip pricing practices lock consumers into\nhigher costs and suppresses competition. The representative also urged the Department to set\npolicies to provide full fee information up front so consumers can make informed purchasing\ndecisions based on the total cost of their itineraries.37\nThe Department continues to receive hundreds of consumer complaints each year\nregarding ancillary fees.38 Based on past experience, the Department understands that the\nnumber of consumer complaints it receives directly from consumers is a small fraction of the\ntotal complaints received each year by airlines and ticket agents.39 The requirements to provide\nspecific baggage fee information and a range of fees for other ancillary services have not been as\nhelpful to consumers in determining the true cost of travel as the Department had anticipated\nwhen issuing its final rule in 2011.\nC. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\nThe Department published its NPRM on Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary\nService Fees on October 20, 2022.40 The NPRM was initially open to public comment for a\nperiod of 60 days (until December 19, 2022). During this time, the ACPAC was informed about\nthe NPRM’s principal provisions and heard from stakeholders at its meeting on December 8,\n2022. Following several commenters’ request for an extension due to the complexity of the\n36 Id. at 9.\n37 Id. at 10.\n38 As noted in the NPRM of the present rulemaking, the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) received\nover 550 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees and over 140 complaints regarding seat fees in 2021. In\n2022, OACP received over 750 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees. During the first 5 months of\n2023, OACP received over 300 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees.\n39 Compare, e.g., the 2,095 disability complaints filed with the Department in 2022 (available on page 66 of Air\nTravel Consumer Report issued February 2023, https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-\n04/February%202023%20ATCR_Revised.pdf), and the 42,306 disability complaints received by airlines in 2022\n(available at https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/2022-disability-\nrelated-complaints-received-all).\n40 87 FR 63718 (Oct. 20, 2022).\nrulemaking, the comment period was extended for 35 days until January 23, 2023.41 On January\n12, 2023, the ACPAC met again to deliberate and make recommendations related to the NPRM.\nThen, on January 18, 2023, the Department received a request to further extend the comment\nperiod on the basis that the requestor was not able to view the January 12, 2023, ACPAC\nmeeting, and that at the time the request for extension was submitted, the meeting materials had\nnot been posted to the docket. On January 20, 2023, the Department declined to extend the\ncomment period based on that request noting that a video recording of the full meeting was\nposted publicly.42 The Department received another request for additional time to provide\ncomments on the NPRM, based primarily on technological and interface issues identified by the\npetitioner. In response, the Department posted a notice to its website stating that it was\nconsidering whether to grant that request and provided a preliminary list of recommendations\nmade by the ACPAC at its January 12 meeting.43\nOn January 23, 2023, three commenters petitioned the Department for a public hearing\non the NPRM pursuant to the Department’s regulation on rulemakings relating to unfair and\ndeceptive practices, 14 CFR 399.75. By a notice on March 14, 2023, the Department scheduled\nthe hearing for March 30, 2023, and reopened the rulemaking to public comment from March 14\nthrough April 6, 2023 (seven days following the hearing).44\n(1) Overview of Proposals\nIn the NPRM, the Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents to disclose\non the first page displayed following an itinerary search the fees for a first and second checked\nbag, a carry-on bag, ticket change and cancellation, and seat assignments that would enable a\nchild 13 or under to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult (“family seating”). The fees\nwould need to be disclosed on the first page displayed following an itinerary search in which fare\n41 87 FR 77765 (Dec. 20, 2022).\n42 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Denial-Extension-Comment-Period. See\nalso 88 FR 4923 (Jan. 26, 2023).\n43 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Procedural-Information-January23-2023.\n44 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023).\nand itinerary information is shown, and they would need to be adjusted based on passenger-\nspecific information provided by the consumer. The NPRM also proposed that the disclosures be\ndisplayed on the screen without the use of links or pop-ups, and that the same disclosures also be\nmade during in-person or phone transactions. To enable ticket agents to provide the disclosures,\nthe NPRM proposed that airlines provide fee rule information to ticket agents that sell or display\nair transportation. The Department did not propose to require that airlines provide the\ninformation to GDSs, which facilitate the purchase of tickets between airlines and consumers,\nbut do not display or sell airline tickets to consumers. The NPRM proposed that these data\nsharing and disclosure requirements would become effective within six months of the issuance of\na final rule. Specific provisions of the NPRM are discussed in more detail in section E of this\ndocument.\n(2) ACPAC Meetings on the Proposals\nAs noted above, after the NPRM was published, the ACPAC held two meetings to\ndeliberate on the NPRM’s provisions and to make recommendations. At its December 8, 2022,\nmeeting, the ACPAC heard from Department staff regarding the proposed rule’s provisions and\nfrom members of the public regarding their views.45 The ACPAC’s airline representative raised\nquestions about the need for a rulemaking and asked about the Department’s application of the\nunfair and deceptive practices standard. He questioned the Department’s analysis of whether\nconsumers were substantially injured. A member of the public representing the International Air\nTransport Association (IATA) also questioned whether consumers were unaware of the price\nimposed for baggage or seating before purchasing a ticket, and he indicated that it would be\ncostly and time-consuming for systems to conduct complex calculations on a passenger- or\nitinerary-specific basis to produce the proposed fee disclosures. He expressed his view that the\nrule should make fee information clear to consumers before purchase rather than during the\nitinerary search stage. The ACPAC’s consumer representative raised questions about the impact\n45 Meeting minutes are available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0110.\nthe proposed disclosures would have on the amount of information being presented to consumers\non screen. A member of the public representing Travelers United expressed the view that\nregulation is needed on fee disclosures and that consumers are harmed if they go through the\nreservation process and find out at the end that extra fees exist. A member of the public\nrepresenting the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) expressed concern about the\nproposed rule’s treatment of offline (i.e., telephone or in person) disclosures, and he urged the\nDepartment to make such offline disclosures available upon request or at the agent’s discretion.\nA member of the public representing the Computer & Communications Industry Association\n(CCIA) stated that aggregators such as metasearch entities should not be subject to the rule.\nOn the issue of data distribution to ticket agents, the IATA representative noted that his\norganization supports the Department’s proposal not to mandate that airlines distribute fee\ninformation to ticket agents through GDSs, but that the costs of implementing the data sharing\nproposal within the six-month compliance period would be significant. Multiple members of the\npublic representing ticket agents and GDSs expressed the view that the Department should\nrequire airlines to distribute fee information to GDSs and disagreed with what they saw as GDSs\nbeing excluded from the proposal. In their view, GDSs were the most efficient method to move\ndata from airlines to ticket agents, and that without using GDSs, ticket agents would have to bear\nresource-intensive costs to enter into agreements with airlines and to make data visible to\ncustomers.\nSpeakers at the December 8 meeting expressed differing views on whether the proposed\ncompliance period of six months would be feasible, with the ACPAC’s consumer representative\nstating that six months was not unrealistic given that capabilities exist for GDSs to provide the\ndata necessary for ticket agents to comply, while speakers representing airlines and ticket agents\nasserted that six months was insufficient time, although acknowledging that the use of GDSs to\ntransfer data could enable the proposed requirements to be implemented more quickly than not\nusing GDSs.\nOn January 12, 2023, the ACPAC publicly deliberated and voted on recommendations\nrelated to ancillary fees.46 The ACPAC recommendations concerned the types of ancillary\nservice fees that should be disclosed, the manner and form of the disclosures (e.g., whether pop\nups, roll overs, or links are acceptable), the timing of the disclosures, the application of fee\ndisclosures to telephone or in-person inquiries, the ability for consumers to opt out of receiving\nthe disclosures, the transactability of ancillary fees, the process for data sharing by airlines to\nticket agents, the entities covered, and the appropriate compliance timeframes. On January 23,\n2023, to facilitate the public’s consideration of this NPRM, the Department publicly posted a\nwritten summary of the recommendations adopted by the ACPAC at its January 12 meeting.47\nThe ACPAC’s specific recommendations are discussed in section E, where the Department\ndiscusses these matters in substance.\n(3) Public Hearing Regarding Proposals\nUnder 14 CFR 399.75, when the Department issues a proposed regulation declaring a\npractice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation to be unfair or deceptive to\nconsumers under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a), any interested party may file a petition to\nhold a hearing on the proposed regulation. Section 399.75 further provides that the petition for a\nhearing shall be granted if the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing that granting the\npetition is in the public interest. Factors in determining whether a petition is in the public interest\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) Whether the proposed rule depends on conclusions concerning\none or more specific scientific, technical, economic, or other factual issues that are genuinely in\ndispute or that may not satisfy the requirements of the Information Quality Act; (ii) Whether the\nordinary public comment process is unlikely to provide an adequate examination of the issues to\npermit a fully informed judgment; (iii) Whether the resolution of the disputed factual issues\n46 The committee voted in favor of moving forward with deliberation and issuing recommendations at the January\n12, 2023, meeting, with the member representing airlines voting against moving forward while the NPRM’s\ncomment period remained open. The meeting minutes are available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-\nOST-2018-0190-0111.\n47 See Procedural Information Regarding Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees (January 23,\n2023) at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Procedural-Information-January23-2023.\nwould likely have a material effect on the costs and benefits of the proposed rule; (iv) Whether\nthe requested hearing would advance the consideration of the proposed rule and the General\nCounsel’s ability to make the rulemaking determinations required by this section; and (v)\nWhether the hearing would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking.\nOn January 23, 2023, three commenters petitioned the Department for a public hearing\non the NPRM. Airlines for America (A4A) raised two questions in its petition: (1) whether\nconsumers are or are likely to be substantially injured or are misled by airlines’ current\ndisclosures of ancillary service fees; and (2) whether disclosures of itinerary-specific ancillary\nfees at the time of first search will result in the display of incomplete or inapplicable ancillary fee\ninformation, cause consumer confusion, and distort the marketplace. The Travel Technology\nAssociation (Travel Tech) stated in its petition that there is a fundamental disputed factual issue\nas to whether the proposed display requirements would benefit or harm consumers. Travel Tech\nalso expressed the belief that the proposed disclosures are technically infeasible and requested a\nhearing to discuss these concerns as well as the Department’s proposed time frame for\ncompliance. In its comment on the NPRM, Google LLC also requested a hearing based on its\nassertion that the Department’s analysis was flawed and that it was deficient in providing\ncomplaint-based evidence justifying the rulemaking. In arguing that a hearing is in the public\ninterest pursuant to 14 CFR 399.75, A4A and Travel Tech asserted that each of the criteria in 14\nCFR 399.75 for determining whether a hearing was in the public interest and must therefore be\ngranted had been met. The Department granted the public hearing to afford stakeholders an\nopportunity, in addition to the public comment process, to present factual issues that they believe\nare pertinent to the Department’s decision on the rulemaking.48 The hearing was held on March\n30, 2023,49 and a video recording of the full hearing was posted to the Department’s website.50\n48 88 FR 13389 (Mar. 3, 2023).\n49 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023). The Department granted a postponement to the hearing’s originally scheduled date\nof March 16, 2023, due to concerns by A4A and Travel Tech that the original 15 days’ notice was insufficient to\nidentify speakers and to compile data responsive to the subjects presented in the March 3 notice. A4A also stated\nthat it would have difficulty finding participants due to the hearing being scheduled during the Spring Break season.\n50 https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AirlineAncillaryFeeNPRM/March30_Public_Hearing_Recording.\nBefore the hearing, A4A raised objections about the designated Hearing Officer\nappointed by the Department.51 The organization made a request for the appointment of a\nhearing officer that would be “neutral,” rather than the Department’s designated Aviation\nConsumer Advocate. Under the Department’s regulation, the designation of a hearing officer is\nleft to the discretion of the General Counsel.52 The duty of the hearing officer is to preside over\nthe hearing and to place the hearing minutes in the docket. The General Counsel, not the hearing\nofficer, determines the Department’s actions following a hearing.53 In addition, the Department\nstated in a Federal Register document54 that the appointment was appropriate because: (1) the\ndesignated hearing officer is a career civil servant who will execute the role in a neutral, fair, and\nprofessional manner; (2) the designated hearing officer’s responsibilities as an Aviation\nConsumer Advocate are the same responsibilities that this individual has as an Assistant General\nCounsel of the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection and such responsibilities do not result in\nbias; and (3) the Hearing Officer’s role is to conduct the meeting using generally accepted\nmeeting management techniques and to not serve as a decisionmaker. As such, the Department\nproceeded with its appointment of the Department’s designated Aviation Consumer Advocate as\nthe hearing officer for the March 30, 2023, hearing.\nA4A also objected to the second subject discussed at the hearing, “whether disclosures of\nitinerary-specific ancillary fees at the time of first search will result in the display of incomplete\nor inapplicable ancillary fee information, cause consumer confusion, and distort the\nmarketplace.”55 A4A stated that, in advance of the hearing, the Department asked the public for\ninformation on current carrier and ticket agent practices, including how ancillary fee information\nis currently displayed, how many existing online booking systems do not display specific\nancillary fees on itinerary search result pages but display ancillary fees on other pages of the\n51 https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0718.\n52 14 CFR 399.75(b)(5)(ii).\n53 14 CFR 399.75(b)(6).\n54 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023).\n55 This subject was offered by A4A in its petition for a public hearing. See\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0091.\nbooking process, whether the lack of ancillary fee information at the time of itinerary and fare\nselection for current systems results in higher total trip costs, and information from consumers on\nthe time spent searching on current carrier or ticket agent websites. A4A asserted that these\nquestions did not address A4A’s intent in presenting the second subject of the hearing, which\nA4A explained was the impact of the Department’s proposals on consumers. A4A stated that the\nfailure to address this issue rendered the hearing ineffective. The Department disagrees with\nA4A’s assertions that the public hearing failed to address the issue A4A posed for discussion and\nthat the hearing was ineffective. In its notice announcing the public hearing,56 the Department\nstated that it welcomed, for issue 2, “data and information regarding any potential for consumer\nconfusion from overcrowded displays or information overload that could result from the\nDepartment’s proposal, particularly on mobile or other devices with smaller displays.” The\nDepartment also solicited “any other information that is pertinent to the Department’s\ndetermination on this proposal.” These requests for information are aligned with A4A’s stated\nfocus of the hearing’s second subject and did not render the hearing ineffective.\nAs provided in 14 CFR 399.75, following the completion of the hearing process, the\nGeneral Counsel shall consider the record of the hearing, and shall make a reasoned\ndetermination whether to terminate the rulemaking; to proceed with the rulemaking as proposed;\nor to modify the proposed rule. Based on the record in this rulemaking proceeding, including the\ncomments submitted by members of the public, the recommendations of the ACPAC, and the\ninformation received during the public hearing, the Acting General Counsel has determined that\nthe Department should proceed with the rulemaking. The Department has made several\nadjustments that reflect the public input received, as discussed in section E.\n56 88 FR 13389 (Mar. 3, 2023), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/03/2023-\n04510/enhancing-transparency-of-airline-ancillary-service-fees.\nD. Statutory Authority\n(1) Unfair and Deceptive Practices\nThe Department is implementing the revised regulatory requirements in this rule pursuant\nto its statutory authority in 49 U.S.C. 41712 to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in air\ntransportation and the sale of air transportation. Under section 41712, a practice is “unfair” to\nconsumers if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable,\nand the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.57 A practice is\n“deceptive” to consumers if it is likely to mislead a consumer, acting reasonably under the\ncircumstances, with respect to a material matter. A matter is material if it is likely to have\naffected the consumer’s conduct or decision with respect to a product or service.58 Proof of intent\nis not necessary to establish unfairness or deception.59 The elements of unfair and deceptive are\nfurther elaborated by the Department in its guidance document.60\nIn the NPRM, the Department tentatively determined that several practices conducted by\nairlines and ticket agents were unfair and deceptive in air transportation or the sale of air\ntransportation. Members of the public provided input on the Department’s preliminary\ndeterminations, including through submission of written comments and statements made at\npublic meetings (i.e., ACPAC meetings and the March 30, 2023, public hearing). After fully\nconsidering the public input, the Department has concluded that the practices identified below\nare unfair and deceptive.\n(a) Bag Fees and Policies\nPursuant to its authority under section 41712, the Department is requiring airlines and\nticket agents to disclose the fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag whenever\nfare and schedule information is provided to a consumer in response to a passenger-specific or\n57 14 CFR 399.79(b)(1).\n58 14 CFR 399.79(b)(2).\n59 14 CFR 399.79(c).\n60 87 FR 52677 (Aug. 28, 2022)\nanonymous itinerary search. The Department is also requiring disclosure of the applicable weight\nand dimensions of the first checked bag, second checked bag, and a carry-on bag before ticket\npurchase on an online platform.\n(i) Carriers\nThe Department has concluded that a carrier commits an unfair and deceptive practice in\nthe sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary\nsearch without providing accompanying information on applicable fees for a first and second\nchecked bag and a carry-on bag and when it fails to disclose weight and dimension information\nfor that baggage before ticket purchase on an online platform.\nRegarding fees, the Department has heard from consumers and other stakeholders that\nsuch fees, which had once been included in the airfare but may now be broken out from the\nairfare depending on the airline, route, fare class, or other factors, are often difficult to ascertain\nduring the itinerary search and ticket purchase process. We find that the practice of not\ndisclosing first and second checked bag and carry-on bag fees with the quoted airfare at the time\nof an itinerary search during the ticket purchase process prevents consumers from knowing the\ntrue cost of their tickets, and that the practice may cause consumers to invest time pursuing a\nticket purchase based on an appealing airfare that ends up resulting in less favorable overall costs\nto the consumer when baggage fees are added. Under this rule, the bag fees disclosed must be\npassenger-specific fees if a passenger affirmatively provides information such as the passenger’s\nstatus in the airline’s frequent flyer program, the passenger’s military status, or the passenger’s\nstatus as a holder of a particular credit card. If the passenger does not affirmatively provide\npassenger-specific information, then the carrier must provide itinerary-specific fees, which\nwould apply to the anonymous shopper, taking into account geography, travel dates, cabin class,\nand ticketed fare class (e.g., full fare ticket). The failure to disclose either passenger-specific or\nitinerary-specific bag fees with the quoted airfare at the time of an itinerary search is unfair\nbecause it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and\nthe harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.\nThe substantial injury this practice is likely to cause is the additional time spent\nsearching to find the total cost of travel and any additional funds spent on air transportation that\nmight have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up\nfront and readily select the best price. This harm is not reasonably avoidable even with the\ndisclosures mandated in the 2011 rulemaking that improved consumer access to first and second\nchecked bag and carry-on bag fee information by requiring those fees to be displayed on airlines’\nwebsites. Airlines often disclose bag fees in an untailored, static format or in complex charts that\nare confusing to consumers and not readily available when consumers need the information to\nconsider whether an itinerary and price offering best suits their needs. The harm that consumers\nexperience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because consumer\nconfusion about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, competition and creates less than\noptimal purchasing decisions by consumers. In addition, because existing disclosure\nrequirements of baggage fees did not apply to online platforms other than websites, consumers\nwho searched for air transportation on those platforms may not have received the baggage fee\ninformation that this final rule now requires. The Department has determined that the disclosure\nof passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary-specific fees whenever fare and schedule\ninformation is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices.\nThe practice of not disclosing passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary-specific fees\nfor first and second checked bags and carry-on bags when fare and schedule information is\nprovided is also deceptive in that it misleads consumers into believing the total purchase price\nfrom one carrier for a particular itinerary or fare type is cheaper than that of another when that\nmay not be the case. This belief is reasonable as carriers and agents often disclose only the\nairfare and not bag fees during an itinerary search. As carriers have different policies regarding\nthe fees and limitations imposed to transport baggage, and because variation within each carrier\ndepends on the fare category purchased or the status of the passenger, the current requirement\nthat carriers inform consumers that fees for baggage may apply and where consumers can see\nthese baggage fees during the booking process is not providing consumers sufficient notice of the\ntotal cost of the air transportation. Consumers are often diverted to complex charts that are\nconfusing, prolong the consumer’s process of evaluating itineraries and fares for purchase, and\nmay ultimately not be instructive for many consumers in determining the bag fee that would\napply to them. The cost of the first and second checked bag and carry-on bag is often material to\nconsumers, as knowing such costs in conjunction with the ticket price is likely to affect the\nconsumer’s purchase decisions as well as whether to check or carry-on a bag.61\nThe Department has also determined that it is an unfair practice to not disclose on an\nonline platform the applicable weight and dimension allowances of a first checked bag, a second\nchecked bag, and a carry-on bag, adjusted based on passenger-specific information if information\nspecific to the passenger has been affirmatively provided. However, the Department is of the\nview that, unlike fees, it is sufficient to provide weight and dimension allowances of a first\nchecked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag before ticket purchase to avoid engaging\nin an unfair and deceptive practice. The Department agrees with the comments, which are\ndiscussed in section E (4)(b), that providing the policy information is less critical to consumers’\ndecision making than the fees themselves; accordingly, the Department is allowing disclosure of\nthese policies later in the ticket purchase process. Nevertheless, the practice of not disclosing\napplicable weight and dimension allowances is likely to also cause substantial injury to\nconsumers if not disclosed prior to ticket purchase given airlines’ policies on bag size vary and\nconsumers who learn that the weight and dimensions allowances of the selected carrier are\nstricter than the common bag size may decide to select a different carrier. This harm is not\n61 As noted in the NPRM, the GAO found that since airlines first imposed checked baggage fees, the number of\nchecked bags per passenger has declined. GAO also explains that checked baggage fees have led to greater amounts\nof carry-on baggage. GAO 10-785, Commercial Aviation: Consumers Could Benefit from Better Information about\nAirline-Imposed Fees and Refundability of Government-Imposed Taxes and Fees (July 14, 2010) at\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-10-785.pdf.\nreasonably avoidable because, even though existing regulations require the disclosure of this\ninformation on e-ticket confirmations, this disclosure is provided after ticket purchase, thereby\ndepriving consumers of the ability to fully evaluate potentially better options for them prior to\nticket purchase. There is no countervailing benefit to consumers or competition from the practice\nof not disclosing weight and dimension allowances of baggage before ticket purchase, as the lack\nof information to consumers reduces their ability to evaluate ticket purchases and harms\ncompetition.\n(ii) Ticket Agents\nThe Department has concluded that a ticket agent commits an unfair and deceptive\npractice in the sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer’s\nitinerary search without providing accompanying information on applicable fees for a first and\nsecond checked bag and a carry-on bag and when it fails to provide weight and dimension\ninformation for that baggage before ticket purchase on an online platform. As noted above, the\nDepartment has heard from consumers and other stakeholders that baggage fees are often\ndifficult to ascertain during the itinerary search and ticket purchase process. This difficulty is\nexacerbated on ticket agent channels in many cases, given the numerous airline and itinerary\noptions presented. We find that the practice of not disclosing baggage fees with the quoted\nairfare at the time of an itinerary search prevents consumers from knowing the true cost of their\nair tickets, and that the practice may cause consumers to invest time pursuing a ticket purchase\nbased on an appealing airfare that ends up resulting in less favorable overall costs to the\nconsumer when baggage fees are later added. The failure to disclose bag fees with the quoted\nairfare at the time of an itinerary search is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial\ninjury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to\nconsumers or competition.\nThe substantial injury this practice is likely to cause is the additional time spent searching\nto find the total cost of travel and any additional funds spent on air transportation that might have\nbeen avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up front and\nreadily select the best price. This harm is not reasonably avoidable, as described regarding\ncarriers in section D (1)(a)(i). In addition, ticket agents provide a means for consumers to\nevaluate different travel options, often on different airlines. The harm of increased time and costs\ninvolved in the ticket purchase process is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or\ncompetition because consumer confusion about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits,\ncompetition and creates less than optimal purchasing decisions by consumers. The Department\nhas determined that the disclosure of passenger-specific fees whenever fare and schedule\ninformation is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices.\nThe practice of not disclosing passenger-specific fees for first and second checked bags\nand carry-on bags when fare and schedule information is provided is also deceptive in that it\nmisleads consumers into believing the total purchase price from one carrier for a particular\nitinerary or fare type is cheaper than that of another when that may not be the case. This belief is\nreasonable as ticket agents often disclose only the airfare and not bag fees during an itinerary\nsearch. The current requirement that ticket agents provide a generic notice that “fees for baggage\nmay apply” during the booking process is not providing consumers sufficient notice of the total\ncost of the air transportation. Although existing regulations require carriers and ticket agents to\ninform consumers during the booking process about where consumers can see baggage fees,\nticket agents may refer consumers to the carrier’s website to search for fees, which would\nnecessitate the consumer leaving the ticket agent’s website, prolonging the consumer’s process\nof evaluating itineraries and fares for purchase. The cost of the first and second checked bag and\ncarry-on bag is often material to consumers, as knowing such costs in conjunction with the ticket\nprice is likely to affect the consumer’s purchase decisions.\nThe failure to disclose the applicable weight and dimension allowances of a first\nchecked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag, adjusted based on passenger-specific\ninformation affirmatively provided by the consumer, is also an unfair practice. The Department\nhas decided to require disclosure of these weight and dimension allowances before ticket\npurchase, rather than during the itinerary search process like bag fees, because the Department\nhas been persuaded by commenters that providing this information is less critical to consumers’\ndecision making than the fees themselves. This practice is likely to cause substantial injury to\nconsumers given airlines’ policies on bag size vary and consumers may have to pay more to\ntransport their bags because of high airline fees for oversized or overweight bags than would\nhave been the case if they knew the weight and dimensions allowances prior to ticket purchase\nand selected a different carrier with a bag size and dimension allowance that suited their\ncircumstances. This harm is not reasonably avoidable, because even though existing regulations\nrequire the disclosure of this information on e-ticket confirmations, the disclosure is provided\nafter ticket purchase, thereby depriving consumers of the ability to fully evaluate the cost of their\nticket before purchase. There is no countervailing benefit to consumers or competition from the\npractice of not disclosing weight and dimension allowances of baggage before ticket purchase, as\nthe lack of information to consumers reduces their ability to evaluate ticket purchases and harms\ncompetition.\n(b) Change and Cancellation Fees and Policies\nPursuant to its authority under section 41712, the Department is requiring airlines and\nticket agents to disclose the fees to change and cancel a ticket in response to a passenger-specific\nor anonymous itinerary-specific search and to disclose ticket change and cancellation policies\nbefore a consumer’s purchase of air transportation on an online platform.\n(i) Carriers\nThe Department concludes that a carrier commits an unfair practice in the sale of air\ntransportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary search without\nproviding accompanying information on applicable change and cancellation fees and fails to\nprovide change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform. The\npractice is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably\navoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.\nThe Department currently requires the disclosure of these fees on or with the ticket.62\nThis requirement, however, means that consumers often receive information about these fees\nafter the purchase of the ticket is already made (i.e., upon receipt of the ticket confirmation),\nwhich the Department determines in this final rule is not sufficient disclosure. The practice of not\ndisclosing these fees while consumers select an itinerary and fare causes substantial injury to\nconsumers in that passengers may not be aware of the change and cancellation fees that apply to\na particular fare being offered, and they may then select a fare without adequate notice that they\ncould incur significant fees to change or cancel their tickets.\nThese harms are not reasonably avoidable if the carrier does not provide disclosures on\nits cancellation or change fees during the itinerary search process and policies before ticket\npurchase on an online platform. Although carriers are already required to have change and\ncancellation policy and fee information available on their websites, the existing rule allows\ncarriers to provide the fee information in a range. Consumers are harmed when they do not know\nthe specific change or cancellation fee that would apply to them during the itinerary search\nprocess, particularly when the ranges provided by some carriers are so wide as to be virtually\nuseless.63 Consumers may also find it difficult to ascertain the change, cancellation, and refund\npolicies that apply to the specific ticket they are selecting if the airline does not disclose such\ninformation during the booking process. Moreover, change fees, even if not in a range, and\nchange and cancellation policies may not be simple to understand, as fare categories, passenger\nstatus, ticket type (e.g., award ticket purchases), and other factors may impact the applicable\n62 See 14 CFR 253.7.\n63 See, e.g., United Airlines, Upgrades and Optional Service Charges (original page accessed Feb. 29, 2024)\n(showing “Other Flight Changes and Cancellations” as “$0 to $1,000 per traveler, based on applicable fare rules”);\nDelta Air Lines, Change or Cancel Overview (original page accessed Feb. 29, 2024) (showing potential change and\ncancellation fees of “$0-400” for non-refundable fares); American Airlines, Optional Service Fees (original page\naccessed Feb. 29, 2024) (showing change fees of “up to $750”). Website screenshots available in docket at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2022-0109.\nchange and cancellation fees and policies. Further, because the cancellation and change fee\ninformation is not provided during the itinerary-search process, consumers would need to\ninterrupt their booking process to search for the information and extend the time needed to\ncomplete a booking. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to\nconsumers or competition because, like baggage fees and dimensions, consumer surprise or\nconfusion about applicable change and cancellation fees and policies harms, rather than benefits,\ncompetition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger-specific or non-\npassenger-specific change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search process would\npromote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices.\nIn addition, consumers are substantially harmed if they are not provided the following\nadditional disclosures about change and cancellation policies before purchase on an online\nplatform: (1) any prohibitions or conditions that limit a consumer’s ability to change or cancel a\nticket; (2) whether the consumer’s reservation can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase\nwithout penalty or whether it can be held at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment,\nprovided the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight’s departure;64 (3) the form of\nthe refund or credit that would be provided; (4) that the consumer is responsible for any fare\ndifferential on a changed ticket, if applicable; and (5) whether the consumer will receive a refund\nof the difference in fare if the consumer changes their flight and selects a less costly replacement\nflight. Disclosure of change and cancellation policy terms, such as whether the consumer would\nbe required to pay a fare differential for a ticket change and whether the consumer can receive a\nrefund in the original form of payment, may impact the consumer’s decision on whether to\npurchase the selected itinerary or wait until the consumer is more certain of their travel plans.\nWhile important, these disclosures of the details of the change and cancellation policies are less\ncritical at the time of itinerary search than the change and cancellation fees themselves.\n64 This rule requires that the carrier disclose its 24-hour cancellation or hold policy on the last page of the booking\nprocess as this is the point in the purchase process at which this disclosure is most relevant to consumers.\nAccordingly, the Department is of the view that, unlike fees, it is sufficient to disclose change\nand cancellation policies before ticket purchase to avoid engaging in an unfair practice.\nThe Department also concludes that the practice of not disclosing change and\ncancellation fees with an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary search and change and\ncancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform is deceptive. Without proper\nnotice, consumers acting reasonably would be misled with respect to the change and cancellation\nfees and policies that apply to their ticket and may believe that changes or cancellations are\npossible at no fee or at a reduced fee. As noted above, many carriers changed their ticket change\npolicies during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and such changes were publicly\npromoted by the carriers. A reasonable consumer may believe that he or she can change a ticket\nfree of charge when that might not be the case, or he or she may choose to purchase a fare type\nthat does not allow changes, believing erroneously that a change is allowed. Comments by\nconsumer advocates and individuals suggest that consumers do consider change and cancellation\nfees and policies when making purchasing decisions, particularly during emergency situations\nsuch as a pandemic or potential severe weather events such as hurricane seasons.65 The change\nand cancellation fees and policies are therefore material because they could affect the\nconsumer’s decision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. As\nsuch, the Department concludes that the failure to disclose change and cancellation fees during\nthe itinerary-search process and change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an\nonline platform is deceptive.\n(ii) Ticket Agents\nThe Department concludes that a ticket agent commits an unfair practice in the sale of air\ntransportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary search without\n65 See comments submitted in the docket for the 2014 NPRM, which can be accessed at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/search?filter=DOT-OST-2014-0056. See also, e.g., Minutes or webcast (at 2:15:55) of\nthe January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, available at https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation-\nconsumer-protection/aviation-consumer-protection-advisory-committee.\nproviding accompanying information on applicable change and cancellation fees and fails to\nprovide change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform. The\npractice is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably\navoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.\nThe Department currently requires that carriers disclose change and cancellation fees and\npolicies on or with the ticket, but current regulations do not require ticket agents to disclose such\nfees and policies during the ticket purchase process. As such, consumers purchasing tickets from\ncertain ticket agents may be unaware of the change and cancellation fees and policies that would\napply to them if they were to proceed with the purchase of a ticket. The Department understands\nthat a substantial number of consumers purchase their tickets through ticket agents.66 The\npractice of not disclosing these fees while consumers select an itinerary and fare causes\nsubstantial injury in that consumers may not be aware of the change and cancellation fees that\napply to a particular fare being offered, and they may then select a fare without adequate notice\nthat they could incur significant fees to change or cancel their tickets. In addition, consumers\nincur substantial injury if they are not provided the following disclosures about change and\ncancellation policies before purchase on an online platform: (1) any prohibitions or conditions\nthat limit a consumer’s ability to change or cancel a ticket; (2) whether the consumer’s\nreservation can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase without penalty or whether it can be\nheld at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, provided the reservation is made one week\nor more prior to a flight’s departure;67 (3) the form of the refund or credit that would be\nprovided; (4) that the consumer is responsible for any fare differential, if applicable; and (5)\nwhether the consumer will receive a refund of the difference in fare if the consumer changes\n66 See, e.g., remarks by a representative of ASTA at the ACPAC’s June 28, 2022, meeting. The representative stated\nthat 44% of air tickets were sold by travel agencies (excluding OTAs), 39% were sold on airline websites, 12% were\nsold by OTAs, and 5% are sold through offline direct channels. Meeting minutes can be found at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0073.\n67 This rule requires that the ticket agent disclose whether it has a 24-hour cancellation or hold policy on the last\npage of the booking process as this is the point in the purchase process at which this disclosure is most relevant to\nconsumers.\ntheir flight and selects a less costly replacement flight. Disclosure of change and cancellation\npolicy terms, such as whether the consumer would be required to pay a fare differential for a\nticket change and whether the consumer can receive a refund in the original form of payment,\nmay impact the consumer’s decision on whether to purchase the selected itinerary or wait until\nthe consumer is more certain of their travel plans. While important, these disclosures of the\ndetails of the change and cancellation policies are less critical at the time of itinerary search than\nthe change and cancellation fees themselves and any prohibitions on the ability to change and\ncancel a ticket, which must be disclosed at that point. Accordingly, the Department is of the view\nthat, unlike fees, it is sufficient to disclose change and cancellation policies before ticket\npurchase to avoid engaging in an unfair and deceptive practice. These harms are not reasonably\navoidable if the ticket agent does not provide disclosures on cancellation or change fees when it\nprovides an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary search and policy information before\npurchase on an online platform. Ticket agents often refer consumers to carrier webpages that\ncontain fee information, but this information is allowed to be expressed as a range rather than a\nspecific applicable number.68 This means that many consumers cannot determine the change and\ncancellation fees that would apply to them. Also, it is disruptive and time-consuming for\nconsumers purchasing from ticket agents to navigate away from the ticket agents’ online\nplatform to the carrier’s website to search for the information. Change and cancellation policies\nand fees may be difficult to understand, as fare categories, passenger status, ticket type (e.g.,\naward ticket purchases), and other factors such as where the passenger is flying may impact the\napplicable change and cancellation fees and policies. The harm that consumers experience is not\noutweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because, like baggage fees, consumer\nsurprise or confusion about applicable change and cancellation fees after airfare purchase harms,\nrather than benefits, competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger-\nspecific or non-passenger-specific change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search\n68 See, e.g., fn. 61, above.\nprocess and policies before ticket purchase on an online platform would promote informed\nbuyers, enhance competition, and lower prices.\nThe Department also concludes that the practice of not disclosing change and\ncancellation fees with an airfare in response to a consumer’s itinerary search and policies before\nticket purchase on an online platform to be deceptive. Without the required notice, consumers\nacting reasonably would be misled with respect to the change and cancellation fees and policies\nthat apply to their ticket and may believe that changes or cancellations are possible at no fee or at\na reduced fee. As noted above, many carriers changed their ticket change policies during the\nCOVID-19 public health emergency, and such changes were publicly promoted by the carriers.\nA reasonable consumer may believe that his or her ticket may be changeable free of charge when\nthat might not be the case, or he or she may choose to purchase a fare type that does not allow\nchanges, believing erroneously that a change is permitted. Comments by consumer advocates\nand individuals suggested that consumers do consider change and cancellation fees and policies\nwhen making purchasing decisions, particularly during emergency situations such as a pandemic\nor potential severe weather events such as hurricane seasons. The change and cancellation fees\nand policies are therefore material because they could affect the consumer’s decision on whether\nto purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. As such, the Department concludes\nthat the failure to disclose change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search process and\npolicies before ticket purchase on an online platform is deceptive.\n(c) Percentage-off Discounts\nAfter careful consideration of the comments submitted in this rulemaking, the\nDepartment has concluded that, when the terms “flight,” “ticket,” or “fare” are used in a\npercentage-off advertisement, it is an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent\nto not apply the percentage off the total cost of the ticket. Additionally, the Department has\nconcluded that, when the term “base fare” is used in a percentage-off advertisement, it is an\nunfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to not apply the percentage off the full\nfare amount excluding all government taxes and charges.\nThese types of percentage-off advertisements are deceptive as they mislead reasonable\nconsumers on a material matter. A reasonable consumer seeing an advertisement for a 25%\ndiscount off a flight, a ticket, or a fare would believe that he or she is receiving 25% of the entire\nticket based on a common understanding of those terms as supported by comments discussed in\nsection E. That reasonable consumer would be misled if he or she were to find out that the 25%\noff discount applied to only a portion of the ticket price. Similarly, a reasonable consumer seeing\nan advertisement for a 30% discount off a “base fare” would believe that he or she is receiving\n30% off the full fare excluding all government taxes and fees based on a common understanding\nof that term as supported by comments discussed in section E. That individual would be misled if\nhe or she received a 30% off only a portion of the carrier-imposed mandatory charges. The\npercentage discounts are a material matter because they affect the price that consumers pay for\nthe air transportation.\nThese types of percentage-off advertisements are also unfair as they have potential to\ncause substantial harm to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable and not outweighed by\ncountervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Consumers may be substantially harmed\nbecause they are likely to encounter higher charges than expected if a seller advertises an\nappealing offer by stating “50% off a flight” or “50% off a base fare” so consumers will click on\nthe advertisements only to find out that it is 50% off only a small portion of the ticket, which can\nmultiply if a consumer relies on the promotional discount for multiple passengers on an itinerary\nor for an individual passenger traveling on a higher cost itinerary. The harm is not easily avoided\ndue to a lack of clarity in the advertising language that carriers use. The harm that consumers\nexperience from this practice is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because\nthe lack of clarity about the offered fare harms, rather than promotes, competition.\n(d) Data Sharing\nThis final rule requires U.S. and foreign air carriers to provide any entity required to\ndisclose critical ancillary fee information directly to consumers useable, current, and accurate\ninformation of the fee rules for critical ancillary services if the carrier provides fare, schedule,\nand availability information to that entity. The information provided by carriers to these entities\nmust be sufficient to ensure compliance with any applicable disclosure requirements. The failure\nof a carrier to provide critical ancillary fee information to entities required to disclose this\ninformation to consumers is an unfair practice. Approximately half of air travel tickets are sold\nby ticket agents.69 There is likely substantial harm to consumers if an entity required to disclose\naccurate critical ancillary fee information to consumers is unable to do so due to the carrier’s\nfailure to provide such information to that entity. Consumers are substantially harmed under\nthese circumstances because consumers must then spend additional time searching to find the\ntotal cost of travel and consumers may spend additional funds on air transportation that could\nhave been avoided if the consumer had the critical ancillary fee disclosed to them. This harm is\nnot reasonably avoidable, as consumers would have to leave the ticket purchase process to\nreview fees provided in each carrier website. In addition, once at a carrier website, consumers\nwill likely not be able to determine the fee for changing and canceling a reservation as carriers\nprovide that information in a range.70 Consumers will also likely have difficulty determining the\nfee for transporting a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and second checked bag because baggage\nfee structures are often complex and require charts and calculators to show the cost of fees. This\nharm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition as the sharing of critical\nancillary service fee information enables consumers to access critical ancillary fee information\nfrom a larger variety of ticket purchase vendors, which improves, rather than harms, competition.\n69 ACPAC Meeting Minutes (June 28, 2022), p. 13 at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-\n0073. In its written comment, ASTA stated that 48 percent of total sales and aggregate spending were sold by travel\nagencies in 2019. https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0083.\n70 See fn. 61 (showing that some airlines provide a large range for change or cancellation fees, with United, for\nexample, quoting “$0 to $1,000 per traveler”).\n(e) Additional Unfair or Deceptive Practices\nAdditional discussion of unfair and deceptive practices identified in this final rule is\nprovided in sections E (1)(c) (failure of a carrier or ticket agent that sells air transportation to\nmake critical ancillary fee disclosures at the first page of its website or other online platform to\nwhich a consumer is directed after searching for flights on a metasearch site where that\ninformation is not provided); E (3)(d) (failure of a carrier or ticket agent to disclose that the\npurchase of a seat is not required for travel particularly when consumers are provided seats to\nchoose where many require a fee to reserve); E (10)(a) (failure of a ticket agent that sells air tour\npackages to disclose that additional baggage fees may apply when a passenger books an air tour\npackage without an identifiable carrier and the failure to disclose the passenger-specific fees for\na carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag when the carrier is known); and E\n(10)(c) (failure of a ticket agent to display baggage fees in text form on the e-ticket confirmation\nthat has traditionally applied to carriers).\n(f) Stakeholder Comments and DOT Responses\nComments: Airlines and airline associations disagreed with the Department’s proposed\ndetermination that not providing fee disclosures at the beginning of the ticket purchase process\nwas an unfair and deceptive practice. Several airline commenters asserted that the Department\ndid not provide adequate justification that consumers experienced or would likely experience\nsubstantial injury, as required by the analysis of an unfair practice. Spirit Airlines asserted that it\nalready displays ancillary fees during the booking process, and that 95% of its customers\nadvance past baggage selection pages, showing that concerns about injury are unfounded. A4A\nstated, “Every A4A passenger air carrier displays or makes available at first search results the\nancillary fee information that DOT proposes for a consumer conducting an anonymous search in\nthe direct channel via rollovers or links.”71 A4A also noted that the Department did not\ndifferentiate its unfair and deceptive practice analysis between airlines and ticket agents in the\n71 Comment of A4A, pages 17-18, available at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0090.\nNPRM, and the organization asserted that the rulemaking should be withdrawn with respect to\nairlines because consumer harm was avoidable. A4A, IATA, the National Air Carrier\nAssociation (NACA), and others asserted that the number of ancillary fee consumer complaints\ncited by the Department was too small to conclude substantial harm, and that the complaints do\nnot evidence a lack of transparency. IATA and other airline associations asserted that consumers\nalready understand that ancillary services are available for a fee, and because they have\ninformation on fees before they purchase tickets, there is no substantial harm. Similar statements\nwere made by airline representatives at the ACPAC meeting held on December 8, 2022. At that\nmeeting, a representative of IATA stated that the Department did not provide evidence that\nconsumers do not know the price imposed for baggage before purchasing a ticket.\nAirlines also asserted that the proscribed practices were not likely to mislead a consumer\nacting reasonably under the circumstances, as required by the analysis of a deceptive practice.\nMultiple airlines noted, for example, that because ancillary fees are already on airline websites, it\nwas not reasonable to conclude that the non-display of fees during the initial itinerary search was\ndeceptive. A4A commented that the Department did not use the right standard for a consumer\n“acting reasonably,” as part of its deceptive practice analysis, and the organization asserted that\nthe Department should instead use enforcement processes rather than rulemaking to address\nproblematic fee disclosure practices.\nIndividual commenters and multiple State attorneys general asserted that airlines were\ntreating consumers unfairly regarding fees and that consumers were likely to be misled by\ncurrent disclosures. Some of these individual commenters expressed frustration about the ticket\npurchase process, noting that when they attempt to buy a ticket they view as being a particular\ncost, the total cost increases when fees are later added. One commenter noted that some\nconsumers would realize they could not afford the total cost of a trip had they known about bag\nfees when they selected their ticket. One commenter noted that it would be extremely rare for a\npassenger to travel without any baggage at all. Another commenter self-identified as a frequent\ntraveler and stated that understanding and paying for ancillary fees was confusing and\nfrustrating, particularly on third-party applications. Multiple State attorneys general commented\nthat they hear every day from consumers who are deceived by “junk fees” and have launched\neducation campaigns to protect consumers from hidden fees, junk fees, and drip pricing. The\nState attorneys general also noted that their offices receive numerous complaints about airlines’\nlack of disclosures of baggage and change and cancellation fees. FlyersRights stated that because\nairlines have increased the number and cost of ancillary fees, consumers are misled into\nbelieving that the cost of air travel will be cheaper than it is. The organization added that\nancillary fees are often necessary for travel and used to be included in the base fare.\nThe Department received mixed comments from ticket agent representatives on its\nassertion that it is an unfair and deceptive practice not to provide disclosure of critical ancillary\nservice fees before ticket purchase. The United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA)\ncommented that the Department did not adequately demonstrate consumer harm, adding that\nconsumers are aware that there are baggage fees and that there were few consumer complaints.\nAs a metasearch entity, Google expressed its view that the Department did not explain how\nconsumers were harmed by not having fee disclosures until the ticket purchase stage of the\nbooking process and that consumers are aware of fees. Google also noted that the Department’s\nsampling of consumer complaints did not show that the fee was not disclosed, but that consumers\nwere surprised by the amount of the fees or the applicability of fees. However, ASTA\ncommented that consumers are confused from airlines’ unbundling their ancillary services, and\nthat ancillary service fees remain difficult for consumers to discover and are hard to understand\nwhen they are found. ASTA added that ancillary fees are revealed too late in the search process\nto permit effective comparison shopping. Skyscanner stated that it shared the goal of enhancing\ncompetition and avoiding the unfair and deceptive practice of failing to inform consumers of the\nfull cost of travel.\nTicket agents also commented on ensuring that they had access to ancillary fee data from\nairlines. One ticket agent commenter noted that consumers using third-party websites to purchase\ntickets may not have access to fee data and that lack of data provisioning is an unfair and\ndeceptive practice. One metasearch entity commented that requiring data sharing with\nmetasearch companies would reduce the risk that the transportation will be sold to consumers in\nan unfair or deceptive manner. As for airlines’ view on data sharing, at the ACPAC meeting held\non December 8, 2022, the airline representative noted the Department did not provide an unfair\nand deceptive practice analysis for its proposal on the sharing of fee information to ticket agents.\nDOT Response: The Department has carefully considered the public comments on this\nissue and has determined that the practices identified in this rulemaking meet the elements of an\nunfair and deceptive practice. Those entities opposing the Department’s position generally\nasserted that the Department did not provide sufficient evidence of substantial injury, that the\nDepartment relied on a small number of consumer complaints, that the consumer harm is\navoidable as the fees are presented on airline websites, and that consumers are aware that\nancillary fees exist. Other comments opposing the Department’s position stated that consumers\nare not interested in ancillary fees when booking tickets and that the Department did not conduct\nan unfair and deceptive practice analysis regarding its data-sharing proposal. The Department\ndisagrees that there is insufficient evidence of substantial injury. Consumer complaints are only\none metric that the Department uses to gauge whether an unfair or deceptive practice is\noccurring. The Department also relies on the statements of consumer advocates, all of which\nhave consistently expressed concern about consumer confusion over ancillary fees throughout\nthe years that rulemaking has been contemplated on this subject. The Department finds it\nreasonable to rely on the statements of the many consumer advocates, State attorneys general,\nand consumer organizations as representative of the views of consumers, and, when further\nconfirmed by consumer complaints, to determine that substantial harm is occurring or is likely to\noccur. These positions by consumers were reaffirmed in their comments to the NPRM.\nComments submitted by members of the public in this rulemaking also clearly evidence that\nconsumers are surprised by the amount of ancillary fees charged when they purchase tickets.\nThe Department also disagrees that the consumer harm is reasonably avoidable. While\nthe fees for baggage and other ancillary services are provided on airline websites, such fees are\nnot disclosed on ticket agent websites and are difficult to ascertain prior to ticket purchase.\nAncillary fees, except for baggage, may be expressed in a range, and baggage fee structures are\noften complex and require charts and calculators to show the cost of fees. Some fees may also\nnot be applicable to passengers who purchase tickets on one airline’s website for flights that will\nbe operated by a different airline.\nThe Department also disagrees with the premise that consumers are well-informed about\nairline fees. While many consumers may be aware of the existence of fees, a large number of\nconsumers do not know the amount of the fees that will apply to them, given the complexity of\nfee structures. Comments from consumers affirm this belief, and Google and others\nacknowledged this fact in their comments. Having fee disclosures up front during the booking\nprocess would mitigate the consumer surprise at the level of fees to be imposed.\nThe Department disagrees with the assertion that consumers not purchasing baggage fees\nduring ticket purchase (or otherwise skipping pages that disclose baggage information) is\nindicative that they are not interested in baggage fees. Consumer advocates and commenters\nhave noted that baggage is a critical ancillary service, and the decision not to purchase baggage\nservices during the ticket purchase process does not mean that the consumer will not purchase a\nbag later or that the amount of the fee is not important to the consumer.\nRegarding the airline representative’s statement at the December 8, 2022, ACPAC\nmeeting that the Department did not conduct an unfair or deceptive analysis of the data sharing\nproposal in the NPRM, the Department has determined in this final rule that failure to disclose\nbaggage and change and cancellation fees to consumers as specified in the rule is an unfair and\ndeceptive practice. The Department has also determined that the failure for a carrier to provide\ncritical ancillary fee information to any entity required to disclose this information to consumers\nthat displays or sells the carrier’s flights directly to consumers to be an unfair practice. The\nDepartment’s analysis complies with its regulations, which require an analysis supporting a\nconclusion that a practice is unfair or deceptive to consumers pursuant to 14 CFR 399.75(c). At\nthe ACPAC meeting, the Department responded to the airline representative by noting that data\nsharing is related to the disclosure of fees because, without data sharing, the disclosure of fees\nwould not be possible for a large segment of consumers. The Department provides its analysis of\nhow the failure to share critical ancillary fee information is an unfair practice in section D (1)(d).\nFinally, the Department disagrees with the suggestion that it should pursue enforcement\naction under its unfair and deceptive practices authority, rather than conducting a rulemaking. As\nstated by the Department at the December 8, 2022, ACPAC meeting, the airline representative’s\nsuggestion that the Department take enforcement action instead of conducting rulemaking would\nbe difficult if the current regulation permits or does not address the practices that are of concern.\nThe Department issues this regulation to address the inadequacy in the current regulation.\n(2) Other Authorities\nIn carrying out aviation economic programs, including issuing this final rule under 49\nU.S.C. 41712, the Department is required to consider the factors identified in 49 U.S.C. 40101 as\nbeing in the public interest and consistent with public convenience and necessity. Under 49\nU.S.C. 40101(a)(4), the Department is required to consider the availability of a variety of\nadequate, economic, efficient, and low-priced services without unreasonable discrimination or\nunfair or deceptive practices as being in the public interest. Under section 40101(a)(9), it is also\nin the public interest to prevent unfair, deceptive, predatory, or anticompetitive practices in air\ntransportation. The Department is also required by section 40101(a)(12) to consider as being in\nthe public interest encouraging, developing, and maintaining an air transportation system relying\non actual and potential competition to provide efficiency, innovation, and low prices.\nExcept for Southwest Airlines, airline commenters generally asserted that the\nDepartment’s rulemaking would harm competition by, in their view, making it more difficult for\nconsumers to view travel options. Ultra low-cost carriers also believed that the rule would\nundermine their business model of unbundling ancillary services from the cost of airfare.\nAirlines expressed the view that the popularity of unbundled offerings showed that consumers\npreferred those models and not that they were being deceived. Southwest Airlines stated that the\nnumber and complexity of fees by airlines made comparison shopping more difficult, and it\ncommented that it was appropriate for the Department to reduce the complexity of disclosures.\nSome ticket agents such as USTOA and metasearch entities such as Google stated that\nthe existing marketplace provided transparency and that the rule would diminish consumer\nchoice and competition. In contrast, others such as ASTA commented that ancillary service fees\nare not accessible in a timely manner and that identifying the total travel cost is complex,\nconfusing, and needlessly time-consuming for consumers. Travel Tech noted that, because ticket\nagents do not universally receive information on critical ancillary service fees from airlines,\nsome ticket agents are currently unable to display those fees at any point in the booking process.\nSkyscanner commented that it strongly supports the Department’s goal of making critical\nancillary fees more transparent for consumers. Some ticket agents also noted that a lack of\ntransactability of ancillary fees on ticket agent websites would disincentivize consumers from\npurchasing air travel on those websites.\nConsumers generally stated that the rule would facilitate price comparison, encourage\ncompetition, and prevent airlines from using hidden fees to gain an unfair advantage. Consumer\nadvocacy groups asserted that market competition requires transparency and informed\nconsumers, with consumers benefiting from the availability of reliable fee information from\nmultiple sources. One individual stated that the rule would reduce options and make travel less\naffordable.\nAfter considering the public comments, the Department has determined that this rule\nserves the public interest as articulated above. This rule improves the transparency of airline\npricing through the increased disclosure of fees for critical ancillary services during the itinerary\nsearch process. As carriers vary on their policies for such fees and such information is often not\nprovided during the purchase process, consumers of air transportation may have difficulty\nunderstanding the actual and potential costs of accessing the air transportation between different\ncarriers. By improving this transparency, this rule allows for better understanding of airline ticket\npricing, of which these fees are often a critical component, thereby encouraging price\ncompetition. The Department acknowledges concern about screen clutter and a potential\nreduction in travel options being displayed to consumers; as such, the Department has adjusted\nits disclosure requirements from those proposed in the NPRM to allow for more flexibility in the\nmanner of display of information and to reduce the potential for the harms identified by the\ncommenters.\nTo answer the concerns of carriers, the Department believes that this rule does not\nundermine the business model of unbundled offerings. The rule does not prohibit such a model,\nand by improving the disclosure of fees associated with ancillary services, the Department\nbelieves that the rule helps to improve the model by making it more transparent to consumers.\nWe do note that the unbundled model has proliferated in the marketplace, but we do not agree\nwith commenters’ assertion that this is evidence that the model is preferred by consumers and\nnot that they are being deceived by airlines’ current disclosure practices. The Department has\npresented its analysis of how a failure of carriers or tickets agents to provide the disclosures\nrequired in this final rule represents an unfair or deceptive practice.\nWe are also not persuaded by ticket agents’ concern that a lack of transactability of\nancillary fees would disincentivize purchases on ticket agents’ websites. As noted in sections E\n(3)(c) and E (7), this final rule does not require the disclosure or transactability of family seating\nfees. The Department is considering issues related to family seating in a separate rulemaking.72\nThis rule also does not require ticket agents to make the fees for a first checked bag, second\nchecked bag, and carry-on bag transactable on ticket agent websites. Due to the post purchase\nprice increase prohibition in 14 CFR 399.88, airlines are currently prevented from increasing the\nbaggage fees that apply to a consumer’s booking after the time of the consumer’s ticket\npurchase. We have seen little evidence that consumers are choosing to forgo using ticket agent\nwebsites as a direct result of not being able to purchase baggage fees on those websites. These\ncircumstances have predated this rule, and the Department does not believe that the addition of\nnew critical ancillary fee disclosures during the purchase process will change that behavior.\nE. Comments and DOT Responses\n(1) Covered Entities\nThe Department proposed to cover U.S. air carriers; foreign air carriers; ticket agents that\nsell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agents,\nor OTAs; and metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers.\nThe Department proposed that GDSs would not be covered by the proposal as GDSs arrange for\nair transportation but do not sell or display a carrier’s fare to consumers.\nThis final rule covers U.S. and foreign air carriers as proposed. It also covers ticket\nagents that sell or display airline tickets, except for corporate travel agents, which are excluded\nfrom coverage for the reasons explained later in this document. This rule does not make a\ndetermination on whether metasearch entities and aggregators that advertise, but do not sell,\nairline tickets, are ticket agents and would thus be covered by this rule. However, if the\nDepartment were to determine in a separate rulemaking73 that metasearch entities and\n72 See https://www.transportation.gov/regulations/report-on-significant-rulemakings.\n73 Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57), (abstract explains\nthat this rulemaking would address whether to codify in regulation a definition of “ticket agent” and whether to\nrequire large ticket agents to adopt minimum customer service standards), Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of Regulatory\nand Deregulatory Action at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-\nAE57.\naggregators are ticket agents as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(45), then they would be covered\nby this rule as well.74 The Department’s response to comments about which entities should be\ncovered by this final rule and explanations for all modifications from the NPRM are described in\nthe sections that follow. Discussion of which operations and online platforms of covered entities\nare covered by this final rule is provided in section E (2).\n(a) U.S. and Foreign Air Carriers\nProposal: The Department proposed fee and policy disclosure of critical ancillary\nservices by U.S. and foreign carriers during the booking process when fare and schedule\ninformation is provided. In addition, the Department proposed to require that the carriers provide\nthe fee information for critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display the airlines’\nfare and schedule information.\nComments: A4A stated that “DOT data does not demonstrate the existence of any\nsignificant problems with airline ancillary-fee transparency, and therefore this NPRM as applied\nto airlines should be withdrawn.” According to A4A, the regulation of airlines is unnecessary\nbecause airlines already disclose fees for critical ancillary services. A4A added that any unfair or\ndeceptive practices occur on indirect channels (e.g., OTAs, metasearch sites, “traditional” travel\nagencies, and travel management companies). An individual commenter stated that the rule\nappeared to be focused on problems with disclosures by large U.S. carriers, suggesting that the\nrule should not cover other entities like foreign carriers and small network carriers.\nDOT Response: This final rule covers U.S. and foreign air carriers because the issue of\nlack of transparency of airline ancillary service fees is not limited to indirect channels as asserted\nby airline commenters or limited to large U.S. carriers as suggested by an individual commenter.\nThe Department wants to ensure that consumers know, when fare and schedule information is\nprovided during the booking process, the fees charged for transporting a first and second checked\n74 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(45) defines a ticket agent as “a person (except an air carrier, a foreign air carrier, or an\nemployee of an air carrier or foreign air carrier) that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale, negotiates for, or\nholds itself out as selling, providing, or arranging for, air transportation.”\nbag, transporting a carry-on bag, and canceling or changing a flight whether they are purchasing\nthe ticket from an airline or a ticket agent. Approximately 45% of tickets are sold by airlines\ndirectly to consumers, and the remainder is sold through ticket agents,75 so it is important to\ncover not only ticket agents but also carriers. Further, it is important to ensure that consumers\npurchasing air transportation from small carriers or foreign air carriers that fly to and from the\nU.S. are protected from unfair and deceptive practices equal to those purchasing tickets from\nU.S. carriers and ticket agents. Accordingly, as discussed in section D, the unfair and deceptive\npractices that the Department is addressing in this final rule relate to ticket agents and carriers\nregardless of the carrier’s size or country affiliation for flights to, within, and from the U.S.\n(b) Ticket Agents that Sell Air Transportation\nProposal: The Department proposed to require all ticket agents that sell air\ntransportation, including corporate travel agents, to disclose to consumers the fees and policies\nfor ancillary services that are critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision. The Department\nsolicited comments in the NPRM on whether it should exclude corporate travel agents from\ncoverage of the final rule because the display content for such agents is typically negotiated by\nthe business client involved.\nComments: The Department’s proposal to apply the transparency requirements regarding\ncritical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell air transportation was challenged only as it\nrelates to corporate travel agents and small ticket agents. Consumer groups, including the U.S.\nPIRG Education Fund, generally supported covering ticket agents. An individual commenter\nasked the Department to clarify that OTAs have responsibility for the disclosure of ancillary fees\nprovided on their websites because carriers lack control over the display of information on those\nsites. Some airlines and organizations, including Spirit Airlines and A4A, expressed concerns\nabout the accuracy of disclosures on ticket agent websites, and Southwest Airlines supported\n75 ACPAC Meeting Minutes (June 28, 2022), p. 13 at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-\n0190-0073.\nextending disclosure requirements to ticket agents. Allied Tour & Travel, a small ticket agent,\nexpressed concerns about the burden of compliance for small tour operators that include airfare\nin a travel package.\nRegarding corporate travel agents, multiple ticket agent associations asked the\nDepartment to exclude them from the final rule’s coverage. These commenters generally stated\nthat the Department should exempt corporate travel agents from the final rule’s requirements\nbecause ancillary fee disclosures by those agents are the subject of contractual agreement\nbetween a business client and the travel agent, with the relevant ancillary services and fees\nnegotiated as part of the contract. The Travel Management Coalition (TMC) testified at the\nDepartment’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that its customers are frequent travelers, often use\nthe same routes, and are highly familiar with ancillary fee information. In addition, Travel Tech\ncommented that certain ancillary fees, like family seating fees, are irrelevant for corporate\nclients, and others, including baggage fees and flight change fees, are not a significant\nconsideration in corporate travelers’ purchasing decisions. TMC agreed that its customers rarely\ncheck bags or travel with children. Further, ASTA noted that the corporate client, not the\nbusiness traveler, generally pays the cost of transportation, including fees.\nThese commenters also cited various precedents for treating business travel differently\nunder consumer protection laws. ASTA and Travel Tech stated that the exclusion for corporate\ntravel agents would be consistent with the European Union’s framework, and TMC testified that\nCongress recognized the distinction between corporate and public travel in the FAA\nReauthorization Act of 2018 (2018 FAA Act) by creating an exemption from certain customer\nservice requirements if the sale of an airfare was made pursuant to a corporate contract.\nTravel Tech, ASTA, and TMC suggested that the Department define “corporate travel\nagent” for purposes of a regulatory exclusion as a travel agency “engaged in the provision of\ntravel services primarily to business entities pursuant to a written contract for the business travel\nof such business entities’ employees.” GBTA instead recommended that the Department exempt\nwhat it termed “private” and “consortia/agency fares” in the final rule. It asked that DOT\nconsider private fares to be “[d]iscounted or lane (fixed fares between two cities/airports) fares\nnegotiated by travel managers that the airline ‘files’ with [the Airline Tariff Publishing Company\n(ATPCO)], to be made available to the organization’s agencies of record, as documented in the\nairline contract, for their travelers to book online or offline.” GBTA further suggested that the\nDepartment define “consortia fares/agency fares” as proprietary fares negotiated by mega\nagencies and consortia76 offered to customers as an alternative to published fares.\nIn contrast, American Airlines urged the Department not to adopt an exception for\ncorporate travel agents. The airline’s comment stated that it is unreasonable and potentially\ninfeasible to exempt corporate travel agents because few serve exclusively corporate travelers for\ncorporate travel and consumers increasingly book travel that combines business and personal\ntravel.\nDOT Response: The Department continues to apply the requirements to disclose critical\nancillary service fees and policies to ticket agents that sell air transportation; however, the\nDepartment is excluding corporate travel agents from these requirements. In excluding corporate\ntravel agents from coverage of this final rule, the Department is agreeing with commenters that\nthere is no need for DOT to apply transparency rules for corporate travel arrangements that are\ncontractually entered into by sophisticated entities.\nIn this rule, the Department is adopting the definition of corporate travel agent as\nproposed by Travel Tech, ASTA, and TMC, with some modifications. This final rule defines\ncorporate travel agent as a ticket agent that provides travel services to the employees of a\nbusiness entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business travel of its\n76\nA travel consortium is a collection of independent travel agencies that combine resources to increase their\nvisibility, revenue, and marketing opportunities. The independent travel agencies that are part of a consortia are\nknown as “mega-agencies” and can offer their customers a consortia rate, which is a preferred negotiated or\npartnership rate.\nemployees. The “ticket agent” need not be a single travel agent to meet the definition in this final\nrule, but could instead be a consortium of travel agents, as suggested in GBTA’s comment.\nWhile some commenters recommended that DOT exclude corporate travel agents if they\nare primarily engaged in such activity, the Department instead adopts a transaction-specific\napproach and is applying this rule to ticket agents that are not acting as corporate travel agents in\nthe specific transaction at issue. Under the final rule, if a ticket agent acts entirely as a corporate\ntravel agent with respect to a transaction or a corporate flight booking portal, for example, then\nthe rule’s ancillary fee disclosure requirements would not apply for that transaction or on that\nbooking portal. Because ticket agents may act as a corporate travel agent with respect to certain\nclients and also have booking systems available to the general public, this rule does not exclude a\nticket agent that sells air transportation from the requirement to display fees or policies for\ncritical ancillary services due to that agent’s “primary” activity as a corporate travel agent. This\napproach ensures information about critical ancillary services are not improperly excluded from\nleisure travelers who are not covered by a contractual agreement. A transaction-specific\napproach prevents consumer confusion from the presence of inconsistent information offered on\ndifferent platforms.\nThis transaction-specific approach also addresses the concerns raised by American\nAirlines that few travel agents serve exclusively business clients. Those travel agents that\nprovide airfare sales exclusively to business entities under a written contract for the business\ntravel of the business entities’ employees would be fully excluded from the rule’s requirements.\nThose travel agents engaged in a mix of business and non-business sales would need to provide\nthe ancillary fee disclosures required by this final rule to any traveler selecting flights who is not\nengaged in business travel covered by a written contract.\nAs for section 427 of 2018 FAA Act, which was cited by TMC in support of its request\nfor an exclusion, it demonstrates that exclusion from consumer protection requirements for sales\nmade pursuant to corporate contracts is not unusual. Section 427 provides protection from\nenforcement for noncompliance of any customer service standard or requirement in a DOT final\nrule that requires ticket agents to adopt customer service standards applicable to carriers to the\nextent “the sale of air transportation is made . . . pursuant to a specific corporate or government\nfare management contract.” While the Department is addressing the issue of whether to require\nticket agents to adopt minimum customer service standards applicable to carriers in another\nrulemaking,77 the Department agrees with TMC that section 427 differentiates between corporate\nand public travel.\nRegarding Allied Tour & Travel’s comment, the Department has determined that the\ndisclosures required by this rule should apply to ticket agents, regardless of size. Creating\ndifferent standards based on the ticket agent’s size would add to consumer confusion, as noted\nearlier, due to the presence of inconsistent information on different platforms. In consideration of\nthe potential for varying degrees of burden, however, this final rule provides those ticket agents\nthat meet the SBA definition of a small entity with additional time to comply with the rule’s\nrequirements beyond the time permitted for other ticket agents, in recognition that it may take\nadditional time for small ticket agents to comply with new disclosures (discussed in section F).\n(c) Metasearch Sites\nProposal: The Department proposed to require entities that do not sell airline tickets but\ndisplay airline flight search options directly to consumers (i.e., metasearch sites) to display\ncritical ancillary service fees when fare and schedule information is provided. The Department\nproposal treated metasearch entities as ticket agents.\nComments: Multiple metasearch entities, CCIA, and Travel Tech expressed their view\nthat metasearch entities do not meet the statutory definition of “ticket agent,” and should not be\nsubject to the rule because they do not sell air transportation. Booking Holdings also noted that\nmany parts of the proposed rule, such as the transactability of family seating fees, were\n77 See Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57) at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57.\ninapplicable to metasearch sites as they do not sell tickets. CCIA also raised privacy and security\nconcerns about the possibility that such entities would need to handle personal or payment\ninformation, which they do not handle today. Google added that it does not currently collect\npassenger information and expressed concern that it would need to do so under the proposed rule\nto verify passenger identities.\nMetasearch entities, as well as CCIA and Travel Tech, also overwhelmingly disagreed\nwith the NPRM’s proposal that metasearch entities be covered under the rule. CCIA, for\nexample, stated in written comments and at public meetings that metasearch entities should be\nexcluded from the rule’s disclosure requirements because they do not have access to fee\ninformation and the rule’s disclosure requirements would clutter and negatively impact displays,\non which aggregators and metasearch entities compete. Booking Holdings added that a\nprescriptive approach to metasearch displays will reduce the number of routes offered as part of\nthe initial itinerary search results and have a detrimental effect on competition. It stated that\nmetasearch entities should be afforded flexibility in fee disclosures to ensure they provide\ninnovative and interactive displays for consumers to quickly be able to understand available\ntravel options.\nFrom the airline perspective, Southwest Airlines expressed support for applying fee\ndisclosure requirements to metasearch entities, noting that they are an important source of\ninformation and that the disclosure rules should apply to them to mitigate consumer confusion on\nfees. The airline added that section 427 of the 2018 FAA Act directed the Department to apply\nconsistent consumer protection requirements to all large ticket agents to the extent feasible.\nDOT Response: The Department recognizes the important role metasearch entities play\nin providing information to consumers and facilitating comparison shopping. As stated\npreviously, the Department is undertaking this rulemaking pursuant to its authority to prohibit\ncarriers and ticket agents from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices. Under 49\nU.S.C. 40102(a)(45), a ticket agent is “a person (except an air carrier, a foreign air carrier, or an\nemployee of an air carrier or foreign air carrier) that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale,\nnegotiates for, or holds itself out as selling, providing, or arranging for, air transportation.” Also\nas noted by Southwest Airlines in its comment, section 427 of the 2018 FAA Act78 calls for a\nconsistent level of consumer protection regardless of where consumers purchase airfares and\nrelated air transportation services. The Act uses section 40102(a)(45)’s existing definition of\n“ticket agent” and clarifies that the term includes “a person who acts as an intermediary involved\nin the sale of air transportation directly or indirectly to consumers, including by operating an\nelectronic airline information system, if the person—(i) holds the person out as a source of\ninformation about, or reservations for, the air transportation industry; and (ii) receives\ncompensation in any way related to the sale of air transportation.” Section 427 directs the\nDepartment to use this definition when issuing its final rule requiring ticket agents to adopt\ncustomer service standards.79 The Department is deferring to that rulemaking its determination\nof whether metasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options\ndirectly to consumers are ticket agents that must disclose ancillary fee information required.\nDuring the pendency of that separate rulemaking, although the Department’s Office of\nAviation Consumer Protection (OACP) has enforced the Department’s aviation consumer\nprotection rules against metasearch entities in the past based on its view that metasearch entities\nare ticket agents,80 OACP will not enforce the disclosure requirements in this rulemaking against\nmetasearch entities. This enforcement position notwithstanding, the Department encourages\nairlines and metasearch sites to enter into voluntary agreements to share critical ancillary fee\ninformation and for metasearch entities to voluntarily disclose this information to consumers\nwith the fare and schedule information while further regulatory action is under consideration.\nThe Department also notes that the Federal Trade Commission has concurrent jurisdiction over\n78 Pub. L. 115-254 (Oct. 5, 2018).\n79 See Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57) at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57.\n80 See, e.g., DOT Order 2022-2-6 (FlightHub Group, Inc., et al.) (Feb. 9, 2022).\nticket agents and has the authority to both determine whether metasearch entities are ticket\nagents and take action against ticket agents as well as entities that are not ticket agents\nirrespective of DOT action.\nTo ensure consumers have access to critical ancillary service fee information upfront,\nwhile the Department considers the status of metasearch entities in a separate rulemaking, the\nDepartment is requiring that airlines and ticket agents that sell air transportation disclose critical\nancillary service fees on the first page of their website or other online platforms to which\nconsumers are directed after searching for flight options on a metasearch site unless the\nconsumer was already provided accurate fee information on the metasearch site. In many cases,\nairlines and ticket agents that provide fare, schedule, and availability information to metasearch\nentities permit the metasearch entity to electronically direct consumers to a page on the airline or\nticket agent’s website that does not require the consumer to initiate a new itinerary search.\nBecause consumers directed to an airline’s or ticket agent’s website or other online platform\nfrom a separate metasearch site may not have an opportunity to view the critical ancillary service\nfees that apply to them, this rule requires that airlines and ticket agents display the required\ncritical ancillary service fee information on the landing page on the airline or ticket agent’s\nonline platform to which consumers are directed after using a metasearch site. The rule permits\nan exception in situations where the consumer was provided accurate critical ancillary service\nfee information on the referring entity’s website.\nThe Department considers it to be an unfair and deceptive practice for a carrier or ticket\nagent that sells air transportation to fail to make critical ancillary fee disclosures at the first page\nof its website or other online platform to which a consumer is directed after searching for flights\non a metasearch site where that information is not accurately provided. As discussed in section D\n(1), consumers are substantially harmed if critical ancillary fee information is not provided to\nthem early in the search process, as ancillary fees such as baggage, change, and cancellation fees\nare critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions and may make up a significant portion of the total\ncost of travel. The harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers will likely not be able to\ndetermine the fee for critical ancillary services even if a consumer expends time and effort by\nleaving the booking system to try to determine the fees that apply to the itinerary. Typically,\ncarriers provide change and cancellation fees as a range when viewed outside of the booking\nprocess. Consumer advocates have also shared with the Department that consumers have\ndifficulty determining the fee for transporting a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and second\nchecked bag because baggage fee structures are often complex and require charts and calculators\nto figure out the fees. The lack of fee information is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to\ncompetition or consumers. In fact, the lack of information hinders consumers from being able to\nunderstand the true cost of their travel and harms competition, rather than benefiting it. The\npractice is also deceptive because a reasonable consumer would be misled to believing the cost\nof the travel is lower than what the true cost is if the fees for critical ancillary services are\nexcluded. The disclosure of the fees is material because the fees could affect the consumer’s\ndecision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select.\nIf metasearch entities are ultimately deemed to be ticket agents subject to this rule, the\nDepartment believes that concerns about screen clutter and impacts on innovation have been\nadequately addressed by the changes the Department has made to the final rule after considering\npublic comments. As noted in this preamble, the final rule provides increased flexibility on\nmethod of display of critical ancillary fees, and it does not require the disclosure or\ntransactability of family seating fees.\nRegarding concerns about privacy and security of consumer data by metasearch entities,\nwhile fee disclosures must be passenger-specific if the consumer affirmatively provides\ninformation regarding their status (e.g., frequent flyer status, military status, credit card holder\nstatus), such consumer-supplied information is not required to be validated before fees are\ndisplayed. Entities covered by this rule are required to disclose passenger-specific fee\ninformation based on the status that a consumer purports to have when conducting an itinerary\nsearch, regardless of whether the consumer holds such status. The rule does not require entities\nto collect passenger name, frequent flyer number, or credit card information, and does not\nimplicate the privacy or security concerns raised by metasearch entities. See discussion on\npassenger-specific information in section E (5).\n(2) Covered Operations\nProposal: The Department proposed to require fee and policy disclosures of critical\nancillary services by airlines and ticket agents on websites marketed to U.S. consumers where air\ntransportation is advertised or sold. On whether a website is “marketed to U.S. consumers,” the\nDepartment noted in the NPRM that the determination would be based on a variety of factors—\nfor example, whether the website is in English, whether the seller of air transportation displays\nprices in U.S. dollars, or whether the seller has an option on its website that differentiates sites or\npages designed for the United States. In addition to the website disclosures, the Department\nproposed similar disclosures of critical ancillary services by U.S. and foreign carriers for tickets\npurchased by telephone or in-person for flights to, within, or from the United States. On fee\ninformation distribution, the Department proposed to require that airlines provide fee and policy\ninformation about critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display airlines’ fare or\nschedule information for air transportation to, from, or within the United States.\nComments: Air Canada commented that the scope of the rule was broad, and that\ncovering websites marketed to U.S. consumers could result in small ticket agents in foreign\njurisdictions leaving the U.S. market because they cannot afford the upfront costs. The airline\nalso expressed concern regarding possible conflicts with foreign consumer protection laws such\nas those in the European Union.\nAmong ticket agent and metasearch stakeholders, Travel Tech and Skyscanner expressed\nagreement with the Department that the rule should apply only to those websites designed for use\nby U.S. consumers. Skyscanner also suggested that the rule’s definition of a “consumer” should\nbe limited to consumers physically located in the United States when searching for or purchasing\ntickets. Similar to Air Canada, Skyscanner argued that covering consumers not physically in the\nUnited States risks legal conflict with consumer protection regulations in other countries.\nBooking Holdings said that the proposed disclosures can be required only when a\npassenger searches for air transportation and added that air transportation as defined by statute\ndoes not apply to flights wholly between two foreign points which it interprets as meaning that\npassengers in the United States who search for flights between two foreign points are not entitled\nto receive the disclosures set forth in this rule. Skyscanner called for clarification on whether the\nrule would apply to foreign carriers serving non-U.S. points on flights carrying a U.S. carrier\ncode, expressing the view that foreign carrier flights between non-U.S. points should not be\nsubject to this rule when not carrying a U.S. carrier code, even if the flight can be booked on a\nwebsite marketed to U.S. consumers.\nDOT Response: After carefully considering the public comments, the Department has\ndecided to require fee and policy disclosures of critical ancillary services by airlines and ticket\nagents if they market to consumers in the United States. Under these circumstances, the final rule\nrequires airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees for critical ancillary services on airlines’ or\nticket agents’ websites and other online platforms such as mobile applications (apps). It also\nrequires airlines and ticket agents to disclose critical ancillary fees to consumers during an in-\nperson or telephone discussion about an airline’s fare and schedule if they market to U.S.\nconsumers. The Department has used the phrase “marketed to U.S. consumers” and similar\nterminology in other aviation consumer protection and civil rights regulations applicable to\nwebsites.81\nIn one of these rulemakings, the Department explained that the characteristics of a “Web\nsite that markets air transportation to the general public inside the United States includes, but is\nnot limited to, a site that: (1) contains an option to view content in English, (2) advertises or sells\n81 See, e.g., 14 CFR 259.6, 259.7, and 382.43(c), and existing regulation 14 CFR 399.85(d).\nflights operating to, from, or within the United States, and (3) displays fares in U.S. dollars.”82\nThe Department further explained “that non-English (e.g., Spanish) Web sites targeting a U.S.\nmarket segment would also be covered; whereas Web sites that block sales to customers with\nU.S. addresses or telephone numbers, even if in English, would not.”83 Similarly, in this\nrulemaking, the Department stated that it would consider a variety of factors to determine\nwhether a website is marketed to U.S. consumers, including whether the website is in English,\nwhether the seller of air transportation displays prices in U.S. dollars, or whether the seller has an\noption on its website that differentiates sites or pages designed for the United States.84 This final\nrule applies the same factors in determining whether tickets are marketed to U.S. consumers in-\nperson and by phone. This final rule’s applicability to online and offline platforms marketed to\nU.S. consumers is consistent with the Department’s longstanding position.\nWe have also considered the comments on the scope of air transportation for tickets that\ninclude flight segments between two foreign points. Congress authorized the Department to\nprevent unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation,85\nwhich includes interstate air transportation86 and foreign air transportation.87 The phrase “when\nany part of the transportation is by aircraft” is used in the definition of foreign air transportation,\nwhich evidences an understanding that foreign air transportation is not limited to a single flight\nsegment between the United States and a foreign country, but that it can be composed of “parts,”\nincluding trips with stopover points and/or flights between two foreign points, provided that the\n82 78 FR 67882, 67886 (Nov. 12, 2013).\n83 Id.\n84 87 FR 63718, 63725 (Oct. 20, 2022).\n85 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(5) defines “air transportation” as foreign air transportation, interstate air transportation, or the\ntransportation of mail by aircraft.\n86 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(25) defines “interstate transportation” as the transportation of passengers or property by\naircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft between a place in a State,\nterritory, or possession of the United States and (i) a place in the District of Columbia or another State, territory, or\npossession of the United States; (ii) Hawaii and another place in Hawaii through the airspace over a place outside\nHawaii; (iii) the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia; or (iv) a territory or possession\nof the United States and another place in the same territory or possession; and when any part of the transportation is\nby aircraft.\n87 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) defines “foreign air transportation” as the transportation of passengers or property by\naircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft, between a place in the\nUnited States and a place outside of the United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft.\npassenger’s overall journey is between a place in the United States and a place outside the United\nStates. However, the Department agrees with commenters that flights between two foreign points\nwith no connection to the United States are not foreign air transportation, and the requirements in\nthis rule do not apply to such flights. The Department has determined that “foreign air\ntransportation” includes journeys to or from the United States with brief and incidental\nstopover(s) at a foreign point without breaking the journey.\nFor purposes of this final rule, we define a break in journey to mean a deliberate\ninterruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a\nforeign country where there is a stopover at a foreign point scheduled. The Department\ndetermines whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption depending on various factors such as\nwhether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and\nthe United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether\nthe segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no\ncodeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from\nthe United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up\nchecked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount\nof time. For example, a passenger that is traveling on a single ticket that originates or terminates\nin the United States but also includes travel between two foreign points on a flight marketed with\na U.S. carrier code would be considered traveling in foreign air transportation. We believe this\napproach fully addresses the extraterritoriality concerns raised by some commenters.\nRegarding comments suggesting that the Department’s requirements apply only to\nconsumers residing in the United States, we disagree. The Department’s authority to prevent\nunfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation is not limited\nto aviation consumers who are residents of the United States. The Department acknowledges Air\nCanada and Skyscanner’s concern about the potential for conflict with international\nrequirements. However, there has not been evidence provided that covering consumers not\nphysically in the United States risks legal conflict with consumer protection regulations in other\ncountries as the commenters assert. Further, although the protection of this rule is not limited to\nconsumers who reside in the United States, this rule only applies to airlines and ticket agents if\nthey market to consumers in the United States.\nIn response to Air Canada’s concern that small ticket agents in foreign jurisdictions may\nleave the U.S. market, the Department is of the view that entities that participate in the U.S.\nmarket by marketing to U.S. consumers must comply with the same consumer protection\nrequirements to ensure consumers know the fees charged for critical ancillary services upfront\nregardless of where consumers purchase air fares and related transportation services. This helps\nto mitigate the potential for surprise fees that can add up and quickly overcome what may, at\nfirst, look like a cheap ticket.\n(3) Critical Ancillary Services\nProposal: The Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents disclose upfront\nfee and policy information for all ancillary services critical to a consumer’s air transportation\npurchasing decisions. The Department proposed to treat the following ancillary services as\ncritical: transporting a first checked, second checked, and/or carry-on baggage, changing or\ncanceling a reservation, and obtaining adjacent seating when traveling with a young child (i.e.,\nfamily seating), but it did not propose a definition of “critical ancillary service.” The Department\nsolicited comment on whether its proposed list of critical ancillary fees should be expanded or\nlimited, how to address future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees, and how\nto ensure their disclosure to the extent that they are of critical importance to consumers.\nGeneral Comments: Several airlines and associations questioned the Department’s basis\nfor selecting those ancillary fees classified as “critical” in the NPRM and not others. For\nexample, United Airlines stated that the list of ancillary fees that the Department proposed to\nconsider critical was “arbitrary and perplexing” and added that it was unclear why DOT had\nproposed to treat the selected ancillary service fees as critical and not others, such as “advanced\nseat assignments, preferential seating, charges for boarding passes, and charges for basic onboard\nrefreshments like water, coffee, and sodas.” Similarly, Air Canada listed “advanced seat\nselection, access to in-flight entertainment, in-flight meals, and lounge access” as other fees that\ncould be disclosed and stated that “to meet the goal of allowing consumers to have full cost\ninformation . . . all ancillary fees of every kind would have to be included on the first page,”\nwhich it acknowledged would be “impossible.” Finally, IATA asked the Department “to set forth\nin greater detail [its] determination that these [proposed] optional services are indeed ‘critical.’”\nA few airline commenters also stated that the selection of fees would disadvantage ultra-\nlow-cost carriers (ULCCs). For example, United Airlines stated, “[w]hether intentional or not,\nthe Department’s choice of ‘critical’ ancillary fees seems to arbitrarily favor carriers who bundle\nthose particular services and disfavors other airlines, particularly [ULCCs],” adding that the\n“rulemaking ultimately could cause a global increase in ticket prices by incentivizing all carriers\nto include those services in the cost of a ticket even though most passengers do not use the\nservices.” Frontier Airlines also expressed a similar view at the Department’s March 30, 2023,\npublic hearing and in its written comments. Frontier Airlines added that, in its view, unbundling\nis more transparent, economically efficient, and lower cost for consumers, who do not need to\npay for ancillary services they will not use.\nA comment from FlyersRights and a joint comment from multiple groups representing\nconsumers recommended that, instead of requiring separate disclosure of ancillary fees, the\nDepartment require ticket sellers to allow consumers to select their desired ancillary services and\nthen provide a single total fare inclusive of the selected ancillary services. The joint comment\nstated that its proposal would allow consumers to “compare search results more immediately and\naccurately,” avoiding clutter and unnecessary calculations by consumers. Consumer groups also\nsuggested that the Department require disclosure of ancillary service fees that may in the future\nbecome more prevalent or may be of particular importance to consumers.\nComments regarding each of the ancillary services that the Department proposed to\nconsider critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions and comments on additional ancillary\nservices are discussed in sections E (3)(a) through E (3)(d).\nDOT Response: The Department has determined that it is appropriate to provide a\ndefinition of “critical ancillary service” in this final rule. This final rule defines critical ancillary\nservice to mean “any ancillary service that is critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions” and\nidentifies transporting the first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag and changing\nand cancelling a reservation as critical ancillary services. In addition, the Department addresses\nthe potential for future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees that may be\ncritical to consumers’ purchasing decisions by including in the definition of critical ancillary\nservice “any other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by\nthe Secretary.”\nRegarding the impact of this rule on ULCCs, the Department does not agree with some\ncommenters’ view that this rule will unfairly disadvantage ULCCs. Rather than placing ULCCs\nat a competitive disadvantage, the Department expects that this rule will promote competition by\nmaking fees for critical ancillary services more transparent for consumers. This will allow\nconsumers to evaluate whether to purchase air transportation on a given carrier, including a\nULCC, with the benefit of more complete up-front pricing information. Given the benefits of the\n“unbundled” ULCC model that Frontier and others touted in their comments, improved\ntransparency should not cause ULCCs to fundamentally alter such a business model (i.e.,\nchanging from an unbundled model to a bundled model). Moreover, nothing in this final rule\nrequires them to do so.\nThe Department is not adopting in this final rule the recommendation of some consumer\norganizations to require airlines and ticket agents to display a total fare that is inclusive of all\nancillary fees selected by the consumer. Currently, some airlines apply different baggage fees\ndepending on when and where the ancillary service is purchased (e.g., in advance, at the airport,\netc.), which may make display of a single fare, inclusive of baggage fees, impracticable. In\naddition, requiring a ticket agent to display a total “fare” that includes baggage that cannot be\npurchased with the ticket on its site could result in consumer confusion about the cost of the fare\npurchased and what it includes.88 Further, change and cancellation fees, which also may vary\nbased on the circumstances of the change or cancellation for any given ticket, may be less useful\nincorporated into the fare presented because the consumer is unlikely to know at the time of\nticket purchase whether they will change or cancel their ticket, and the applicability of certain\nfees may be mutually exclusive (e.g., a fee to cancel a ticket 30 days in advance and a fee to\ncancel a ticket on the day of travel cannot both be imposed).\n(a) Transporting First Checked Bag, Second Checked Bag, and Carry-on Bag\nProposal: The Department proposed to treat fees for a first checked, second checked, and\na carry-on bag as critical ancillary fees that airlines and ticket agents must disclose to consumers\nwith fare and schedule information. This proposal was intended to replace the existing\nrequirement for carriers and ticket agents to provide a generic notice during the booking process\nthat baggage fees may apply and where the consumer can find these fees on the carrier’s website.\nIn proposing to treat fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag\nas critical, the Department noted that consumer commenters to the Department’s 2014 NPRM\nmost commonly identified these baggage fees as critical, and such fees continue to serve as a\nleading source of consumer complaints regarding ancillary fees to the Department.89 The\nDepartment further explained that the cost of baggage fees is often material to consumers and\nlikely to affect their purchasing decisions. In addition, the Department noted that, although the\n2011 final rule improved consumer access to baggage fee information by requiring airlines and\nticket agents to display the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on bags on their\n88 This final rule does not require baggage fees to be transactable by ticket agents for the reasons discussed in\nsection E (7).\n89 See Number of Consumer Complaints Received by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Aviation\nConsumer Protection Regarding Ancillary Fees, 2019-May 31, 2023, available in docket at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2022-0109.\nwebsites, airlines and ticket agents often disclose those fees in static form in charts that are\nconfusing to consumers and may be provided outside of the booking flow. The Department also\nnoted that consumers continue to report confusion regarding the total cost of baggage fees in\nconnection with complex itineraries, interline tickets, and codeshare flights.\nComments: Industry commenters were split on whether the fees for first checked bag,\nsecond checked bag, and carry-on bag are critical to consumer’s purchasing decisions. Airlines\nand airline associations generally took the position that such fees were not critical. Some ticket\nagents agreed with the Department’s preliminary conclusion that fees for first checked bag\nsecond checked bag, and carry-on bag are critical; other ticket agents disagreed.\nIndustry commenters who stated that fees for first checked bag, second checked bag, and\ncarry-on bag are not critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions asserted that such fees are\nalready available under existing industry practices and regulatory requirements and that\nconsumers are aware of the existence of baggage fees. For example, Air Canada stated that\n“baggage fee information is already transparent and fully disclosed on a carrier’s website where\npassengers have easy access to relevant information,” citing to its own general baggage fee\ndisclosures. Frontier Airlines noted that it discloses ancillary fee information to consumers\nduring the booking process before purchase. Similarly, American Airlines commented that it\ncurrently provides itinerary- or passenger-specific baggage fees before purchase, and IATA\nstated at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that one large international carrier\nfound that 98 percent of the visits to that airline’s websites exposed passengers to the pages with\nfees on baggage, seat selection, and refund policies, while the remaining two percent of\nconsumers did not go far enough in the booking flow to see these fees. At that hearing, A4A\nadded that many consumers are members of loyalty programs and are already aware of the\nancillary structures of their preferred carriers. Further, Air Canada commented that the decrease\nin checked baggage and increase in carry-on baggage since the addition of checked baggage fees\n– documented in a GAO study that the Department cited in the NPRM – “supports a logical\nconclusion that consumers are evidently aware of checked-baggage fees.” Air Canada also\nstated, however, that “[c]alculation of baggage fees is a complex process and the display of this\ninformation on the first page where fares are shown cannot be calculated in certain instances\nuntil the carriers are chosen, such as on a multi-carrier itinerary.” IATA raised similar concerns\nabout the complexity of calculating these fees.\nThese commenters added that, in their view, the number of complaints related to baggage\nfee disclosures and the number of passengers who travel without baggage demonstrate that such\nfees are not critical. For example, Frontier Airlines asserted that the number of baggage fee\ncomplaints received by the Department was “de minimis.” Similarly, IATA testified at the\nDepartment’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that in 2022, 3.64 percent of airline complaints\nrelated to baggage, with a vast majority pertaining to baggage fee refunds, and Booking Holdings\nreported that approximately 0.1 percent of the U.S. complaints received by Priceline in 2022\nrelated to baggage fees. In addition, A4A testified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, hearing\nthat the lack of civil penalties against U.S. airlines demonstrated the absence of a market failure\nrequiring additional regulation. Frontier Airlines further stated in its hearing testimony and in\nwritten comments that over 40 percent of Frontier’s passengers do not pay any seating and\nbaggage fees, fewer than 30 percent purchase a first checked bag, fewer than five percent\npurchase a second checked bag, and fewer than 20 percent purchase a carry-on bag. Further,\nAmerican Airlines commented that “the majority of travelers on American Airlines do not check\nany luggage, and less than a quarter of travelers on American [Airlines] actually have to pay for\nany checked bags.”\nA lack of use by consumers of Google’s baggage filter tool was also cited by A4A in its\ntestimony at the Department’s March 30, 2023, hearing as evidence that baggage fees are not\ncritical to consumers’ purchasing decisions. Google had commented that only 1.3 percent of the\nconsumers conducting a search on Google Flights use a feature that enables consumers to\nintegrate bag fees into the displayed costs for flights. Google provided this data to support its\nsuggestion that the Department “consider deferring the disclosure [of ancillary service fees] until\nafter a specific itinerary has been selected.” Google did not assert that transporting baggage is\nnot a critical ancillary service. Further, in a supplemental response, Google presented the results\nof a 2018 survey it conducted of U.S. consumers which showed that 54% of people decide about\nbaggage for travel prior to ticket purchase.\nSimilarly, other industry commenters who agreed with the Department’s preliminary\nconclusion that fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage are critical to\nconsumers’ purchasing decisions generally stated that baggage was the most common type of\nancillary service used by consumers. For example, Travel Tech stated that “baggage fees are the\nmost important ancillary fees” for most passengers because “[a]lmost all airline passengers travel\nwith some amount of baggage, whether carry-on or checked, and baggage fees often constitute a\npractical limit on what consumers can carry with them on trips or what they can bring back from\na destination.” Though it agreed that baggage fees are important to consumers, Travel Tech\ntestified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that, based on a survey it\nconducted, 90 percent of U.S. adults are aware of the possibility of paying additional fees for\noptional services beyond the cost of their airline ticket. But Travel Tech acknowledged that the\nstudy did not ask whether consumers were aware of the amount of such fees. Also supporting the\nimportance of baggage fees, Skyscanner reported that its internal user research demonstrated that\n“many users are much more concerned about baggage allowances and fees than any single other\ntype of ancillary fee,” with 84 percent of surveyed users stating it was important to know\nwhether a ticket price includes checked baggage. Similarly, Google reported that in a survey it\nconducted of U.S. consumers in 2018, 71 percent planned to check one bag, six percent planned\nto check more than one bag, and 21 percent did not plan to check any baggage.\nGroups representing consumers and some individual consumers also supported the\nDepartment’s proposal to treat fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on\nbag as critical and to require improved disclosures of those fees. For example, at the\nDepartment’s March 30, 2023, hearing, an American Economic Liberties Project (AELP)\nrepresentative stated that at the nonprofit organizations where he worked including AELP, he\nheard from many air travelers who were unaware of fees charged by the ULCCs, including fees\nfor carry-on baggage. This representative further testified that while awareness of checked bag\nfees has risen, carry-on baggage fees continuously confound travelers and that both consumer\norganizations where he recently worked receive many complaints from consumers about carry-\non and checked baggage fees. This representative cited one instance in which a passenger on\nSpirit Airlines reported that he had to leave his carry-on bag in his car at the airport because he\ndid not have enough money for the carry-on baggage fee and assumed that only checked bags\nincurred fees. The Department notes that in response, Spirit Airlines commented that AELP did\nnot provide a date for this incident and stated that it did not appear to be consistent with current\nconsumer knowledge about unbundled fares. The AELP representative added that many travelers\nfly less than once a year and do not understand the intricacies of flying and are confused by\nancillary fees. In addition, FlyersRights testified that improved disclosure of the ancillary fees\nproposed in the NPRM would decrease consumer confusion and allow airlines to compete based\non the total cost of a ticket.\nSimilarly, most individual consumers who commented on this aspect of the proposal\nrequested improved baggage fee disclosures for reasons including that, in their view, it is rare for\nconsumers to travel with no bags at all, baggage fees can significantly increase the total cost of\nair travel, and improved disclosures would enable comparison shopping. For example, one\nconsumer expressed being surprised with fees for checked baggage and stated that requiring\ndisclosure of baggage fees when airlines and ticket agents first provide itinerary search results\n“would be immensely helpful in comparing prices via airfare website searches” and cited his\nexperience purchasing a flight on a ticket agent’s website, only to discover after purchase that\nundisclosed baggage fees made the overall cost of travel higher than on another airline that the\nconsumer had passed over during the search process.\nFinally, AARP generally supported the Department’s baggage fee disclosure proposal but\nalso asked DOT to prohibit first checked bag fees entirely, and members of the Commissioned\nOfficers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) asked DOT to encourage\nairlines to waive baggage fees for all members of the uniformed service, including the USPHS.\nDOT Response: The Department has determined that fees for a first checked, second\nchecked, and carry-on bag are critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision. The Department\ndisagrees with industry commenters’ assertion that the first checked bag, second checked bag,\nand carry-on bag are not critical, and that their disclosure is unnecessary. Consumers have voiced\nconcerns that the fees for these bags can significantly increase the total price of the airfare\nbeyond what was offered at the time of itinerary search. While estimates of the percentage of\nconsumers who travel with a first checked bag, second checked bag, or carry-on bag vary among\ncommenters, most comments support the conclusion that many consumers travel with a first\nchecked, second checked, and/or carry-on bag. Statements by Travel Tech and others that most\nconsumers travel with at least one type of baggage are supported by Google’s comment that its\nsurvey reflects that 71 percent of U.S. consumers plan to check a bag on an upcoming trip.\nSkyscanner’s internal survey and comments from consumer advocates and individual consumers\nprovide further support for the conclusion that these fees are critical to consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions. Given this information, the Department is not persuaded by airlines’ arguments that\nfees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag are unimportant to consumers\nbased on the percentage of consumers conducting a search on Google Flights for baggage\ninformation and the number of passengers who travel without baggage.\nIn addition, as discussed in section B, GAO has documented that baggage fees have\nshifted consumers’ purchasing behavior by encouraging consumers to bring only a carry-on bag\nto avoid checked bag fees. Air Canada cited this GAO study as support for its view that\npassengers are aware of the existence of baggage fees, and Travel Tech similarly reported that its\nown survey indicated that 90 percent of consumers were aware that ancillary fees may be\ncharged. However, neither the GAO study nor any of the comments submitted provide evidence\nthat consumers are aware of the amount of the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-\non baggage at various airlines. Indeed, the complexity that Air Canada and IATA observed that\ncarriers face in calculating baggage fees is likely even more burdensome to consumers who try to\ncalculate the fees applicable to their itineraries based often on static information provided by\ncarriers and ticket agents.\nIn addition, some airlines now charge passengers for carry-on baggage. Indeed, on some\ncarriers, the fees for a carry-on bag may be more costly than a first checked bag, which may\nsurprise consumers who are accustomed to carrying on bags without charge.90 These\ndevelopments further demonstrate the need for carriers and ticket agents to disclose the fees for a\nfirst checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag to consumers so that consumers\nunderstand how baggage fees may affect the total cost of their airfare and are able to determine\nwhich carrier’s flight option best suits their circumstances.\nThe Department concludes that existing required disclosures do not adequately address\nthe harm to consumers. Carriers and ticket agents are currently not required to provide fees for a\nfirst checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag in a manner that is readily available\nwhen consumers are considering a given fare and itinerary. Instead, fees are often provided in\nstatic charts that confuse consumers and do not provide adequate information about the fees that\napply based on the consumer’s passenger-specific information. The fact that some carriers may\nvoluntarily provide passenger-specific baggage fee information required by this new rule is not a\nreason for the Department not to require its disclosure by all ticket agents and airlines.\nThe Department rejects airline commenters’ argument that the number of complaints\nrelated to baggage fee disclosures and lack of civil penalties for baggage fee violations\ndemonstrate that such fees are not critical. As explained in section B, the number of complaints\n90 See Comments of Spirit Airlines at 12; see also Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees\nRegulatory Impact Analysis RIN 2105-AF10, Table 1, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-\nOST-2022-0109-0002.\nis only one consideration used to determine whether the Department should address an unfair or\ndeceptive practice through regulation. Also, the Department does not view the lack of civil\npenalties against U.S. carriers under existing regulatory requirements to demonstrate that a\nregulation is not needed. The lack of civil penalties under existing rules could instead provide\nfurther support for the Department’s conclusion that its concerns with existing ancillary fee\ndisclosures are not adequately addressed by existing regulations.\nThe Department is not adopting recommendations by AARP to prohibit fees for a first\nchecked bag and by the Officers Association of the USPHS to encourage airlines to waive fees\nfor its members because those recommendations are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.\n(b) Changing and Cancelling a Reservation\nProposal: In the NPRM, the Department identified fees for changing or canceling a\nreservation as being critical to consumers when they choose among air transportation options.\nThe Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose change and\ncancellation fees and policies to consumers during the booking process when fare and schedule\ninformation is provided.\nIn proposing to treat these services as critical, the Department shared its view that not\ndisclosing to passengers upfront the significant fees that they would incur should they need to\nchange or cancel the reservation is an unfair and deceptive practice. The Department explained\nthat carriers are currently not required to provide consumers with change or cancellation fee\ninformation until after ticket purchase. In addition, the Department noted that although carriers\nmay have separate webpages that list change and cancellation fees, this information is permitted\nto be provided in a range. The Department added that, even if not provided in a range, change\nand cancellation fees may not be simple to understand, as fare categories, passenger status, ticket\ntype, and other factors may impact the applicable change and cancellation fees. Further, the\nDepartment explained that carriers are currently permitted to display change and cancellation\nfees outside the booking flow, which disrupts passengers’ searches and costs them time. Finally,\nthe Department reported that change and cancellation fees are among the top three types of\nancillary service complaints it receives.\nComments: Groups representing consumers generally supported the Department’s\nproposal to consider change and cancellation fees to be critical to the consumer’s purchasing\ndecision and to require airlines and ticket agents to display such fees to consumers. A joint\ncomment from multiple groups representing consumers noted that improved disclosure of change\nand cancellation fees “would benefit consumers, particularly because many travelers may not\nbudget for such fees when booking flights.” This comment further observed that, based on data\nfrom the Department’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), air carriers collected nearly $3\nbillion in revenue from these charges in 2019.91 The commenter asserted that while some airlines\nhad modified their change and cancellation policies due to COVID-19, the changes were limited,\nwith many airlines still applying these fees to the lowest-tier fares. In addition, FlyersRights\ntestified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that disclosure of the critical\nancillary fees identified in the NPRM would decrease consumer confusion and improve\ncompetition in the market. AARP also supported the proposed requirement for carriers and ticket\nagents to display change and cancellation fees but asked the Department to work to reduce or\neliminate change and cancellation fees.\nIn contrast, airlines and their associations generally opposed the Department’s proposal to\ntreat ticket changes and cancellations as critical ancillary services. These commenters asserted\nthat such services are not critical because few passengers change or cancel flights, and\ncomplaints regarding change and cancellation fees represent a small percentage of the overall\nnumber of complaints submitted to the Department. In addition, airlines and their associations\nstated that airlines already provide disclosure of change and cancellation fees on their websites,\nconsumers are already aware of the potential costs associated with changing or cancelling a\n91 Citing “Reservation Cancellation/Change Fees by Airline 2021,” Bureau of Transportation Statistics. May 2,\n2022, https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/reservation-cancellationchange-fees-airline-2021.\nflight, and many carriers have removed these fees since the emergency of the COVID-19\npandemic. Among these commenters, American Airlines noted that 15 percent of its passengers\nchange or cancel flights, and Frontier testified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, hearing that\nfewer than 10 percent of its passengers paid change or cancellation fees. A4A testified at the\nsame hearing that the cancellation fee complaints to the Department included in the docket do\nnot appear to be related to transparency and represent a small percentage of the overall number\nof passengers, and so, in its view, the mandatory display of those fees is unnecessary.\nTicket agents and their associations offered different views on whether change and\ncancellation fees are critical to consumers’ purchasing decisions and should be displayed.\nAmadeus stated that change and cancellation fees are critical to consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions, and Travel Tech supported disclosure of these fees before purchase. However, the\nU.S. Travel Association stated that the fees identified by the Department “are incidental and not\n‘critically important’ to air transportation.” In addition, at the Department’s March 30, 2023,\npublic hearing, Skyscanner expressed concern that disclosing only a fixed change fee without\nalso disclosing the applicable fare difference, which would necessarily be unknown at the time of\npurchase, would provide incomplete information to consumers and cause confusion. Air Canada\nmade a similar argument in its written comments.\nThree of the four ACPAC members expressed the view that ticket change and\ncancellation fees were critical to consumers. The ACPAC Chair, who is also the member\nrepresenting state governments, stated that the ability to change and cancel a ticket was more\nimportant to consumers now due to an increase in flight cancellations and the potential for an\nincrease in infectious disease numbers. The ACPAC had several recommendations related to\nticket change and cancellation, which are discussed in later sections.\nDOT Response: The Department has determined that the fees imposed on a consumer to\nchange or cancel a ticket (i.e., passenger-initiated changes or cancellations)92 are critical to a\nconsumer’s purchasing decision, and this final rule maintains the proposed requirement that\nairlines and ticket agents must disclose these fees to consumers. The Department is not\npersuaded by industry commenters who stated that change and cancellation fees are not critical,\nand disclosure is unnecessary. The Department agrees with the commenters who stated that\nchange and cancellation fees can pose a significant, unexpected financial burden to consumers\nand that improved transparency will reduce consumer confusion and promote competition.\nAs noted in section B, the number of complaints is only one consideration used to\ndetermine whether the Department should address an unfair or deceptive practice through\nregulation. Nor do the calculations by some airlines that 10-15 percent of their passengers\nchange or cancel flights suggest that change and cancellation fees are not critical given the\nsignificant financial cost that change and cancellation fees impose to those passengers who are\nsubject to them. In addition, existing disclosure requirements do not address this issue. As the\nDepartment noted in the NPRM, existing regulations do not require airlines or ticket agents to\ndisclose specific change and cancellation fees during the booking process before ticket purchase.\nThere are no existing rules for ticket agents to provide change and cancellation fees, and the\nexisting rules allow airlines to provide change and cancellation fees in ranges rather than specific\namounts, making it difficult for consumers to determine the fee that would apply to their ticket.\nThe Department is not persuaded that it should defer regulation in this area because some\ncarriers have eliminated change and cancellation fees. These carriers could re-impose such fees\nin the future. Further, some carriers that have eliminated change and cancellation fees have not\ndone so for all their flights. For example, these carriers may charge change or cancellation fees\nfor international flights that do not originate from designated locations. Also, many passengers\n92 When referring to change or cancellation fees or policies, this rule is referring to consumer- or passenger-initiated\nchanges or cancellations of tickets. This rule does not address changes or cancellations initiated by carriers.\nwho purchase tickets in the lowest fare categories continue to be subject to either change and\ncancellation fees or outright prohibitions on changing or cancelling their reservations.\nThe Department agrees with those commenters who noted that providing change fee\ninformation without information about the requirement to pay a fare difference may create\nconsumer confusion. Because the amount of any fare difference cannot be calculated until a\nreplacement flight is selected, the amount of the fare difference will necessarily be unknown at\nthe time of initial ticket purchase. To reduce any potential for consumer confusion, this final rule\nrequires airlines and ticket agents to disclose in the summary of its change policies that a fare\ndifference may apply, if that is the case, and to make other related disclosures before ticket\npurchase. These requirements are discussed further in section E (4)(b).\n(c) Obtaining Adjacent Seats for Families Traveling with Young Children\nProposal: The Department proposed that a fee for a child 13 or younger to be seated\nadjacent to an accompanying adult in the same class of service is a critical ancillary fee that\nairlines and ticket agents must disclose to consumers with the fare and schedule information.\nUnder the proposal, if the carrier does not impose a fee for children 13 or under to be seated next\nto an accompanying adult, no seat fee disclosure would be required for the carrier’s flights. If the\ncarrier does impose a fee to make an advance seat assignment for a child 13 or under, the NPRM\nnoted that the carrier could comply with the proposed rule by enabling consumers to indicate\nwhether they were traveling with a child prior to initiating a search, or by displaying seat fees for\nall itinerary searches, regardless of whether a consumer indicated that he or she would be\ntraveling with a child.\nComments: The overwhelming majority of commenters opposed the Department’s family\nseating fee disclosure proposal in the NPRM. Hundreds of individuals and multiple consumer\nadvocacy organizations, including the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, opposed the proposal on the\nbasis that the Department should prohibit family seating fees for air travel instead of requiring\nfee disclosure. Individual commenters expressed concern with the safety of minors and the\ncomfort of families and other passengers when children 13 or younger are seated away from an\naccompanying adult on an aircraft. Consumer advocates raised similar concerns. For example,\nAELP testified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that there are serious health\nand safety issues with seating young children alone and stated that the Department should not be\nguided by the quantity of complaints it receives on family seating. The few consumer advocates\nthat supported the Department’s proposal similarly recommended that the Department ultimately\nlimit or prohibit family seating fees, with AARP noting that it viewed the proposed disclosures\nas “an essential first step” but also asking the Department to take further action to reduce or\neliminate such fees in the future. A joint comment from multiple State attorneys general\nsupported improved seat disclosures but asked DOT to modify its proposal to require that initial\nsearch results provide the lowest fee, if any, to book two adjacent seats, along with an additional\ndisclosure if adjacent seats are unavailable.\nMany industry commenters raised concerns about the expense and technical challenges of\nproviding dynamic seat fees at the first page of search results and the cost of establishing direct,\nreal-time connections between ticket agents and airlines necessary to facilitate such disclosures.\nIATA stated that the Department’s family seating proposal would impose a greater burden on\nairlines than the proposals to require disclosure of baggage, change, and cancellation fees\n“because the search [for adjacent seating] is twofold: the fees for each seat on each flight\npresented in an itinerary as well as a search to determine whether there are two or more seats\ntogether at the time of the initial search.” ATPCO explained that “a channel would need at or\nnear real-time seat maps and seat pricing for every possible airline’s flight for every itinerary\nevaluated at the time of the shopping request” to provide seat fees at first search. Skyscanner\nexplained that determining a family seating fee would require a complex search of highly\ndynamic seat fees of varying costs and a query of availability, suggesting that, as an alternative,\nthe Department should require disclosure of the cost of a standard seat and not at the time of first\nsearch. Among other commenters, Air Canada and IATA stated that GDSs are currently unable\nto support the distribution of dynamic seat fee information. Industry commenters also expressed\nconcerns that providing family seating fees at the time of first search would overwhelm\nconsumers and provide information that would be irrelevant to many passengers who are not\ntraveling with children. Several industry commenters also stated that consumers rarely consider\nseats relevant at the beginning of their itinerary search, with Google citing a user survey it had\nconducted in support of that position.\nAirlines and their representatives generally opposed all aspects of the Department’s\nfamily seating proposal. Airlines stated that current airline policies generally already provide for\nfamily seating without fees; the display of a “family seating fee” may confuse passengers about\nthe need to purchase a seat to guarantee seating next to a young child; and what these\ncommenters characterized as the low number of family seating complaints and low number of\npassengers traveling with young children demonstrated no problem with existing disclosures.\nAmerican Airlines asserted that it could not disclose family seating fees because “they do not\nexist” separate from advance seating fees for all other passengers and noted its efforts to seat\nyoung children with an accompanying adult.\nAmadeus, Travelport, and Travel Tech asked that DOT expand its family seating\nproposal to require airlines to either share all seat fees or the fees for the cost of an adjacent seat\ngenerally, without regard to whether the passenger is traveling with a child 13 years old or\nyounger. None of those commenters, however, supported displaying seat fees on the first page of\nsearch results.\nAt its January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC recommended that the Department’s\nproposal regarding the disclosure of family seat fee information should be retained in any final\nrule that may be adopted.\nDOT Response: DOT has decided not to move forward with its proposal to require\ncarriers and ticket agents to disclose applicable fees for passengers 13 or under to be seated next\nto an accompanying adult on an aircraft. Instead, the Department is pursuing a separate\nrulemaking to address the ability of a young child to sit adjacent to an accompanying adult at no\nadditional cost beyond the fare.93\nIn addition to pursuing a new rulemaking, the Department has taken other steps to\nencourage airlines to ensure that children 13 or younger are seated adjacent to an accompanying\nadult at no additional cost subject to limited conditions. On July 8, 2022, the Department’s\nOACP issued a notice urging airlines to do everything they can to allow young children to be\nseated next to an accompanying adult with no additional charge.94 On March 6, 2023, the\nDepartment launched its Airline Family Seating Dashboard, that highlights whether airlines\nguarantee fee-free family seating,95 and on March 10, 2023, the Department sent a proposal to\nCongress recommending legislation to require fee-free family seating subject to limited\nexceptions.96\nGiven these actions by the Department to enable parents to sit next to their young\nchildren without paying fees, the Department does not see value to requiring airlines and ticket\nagents to display dynamic family seating fees in this final rule. In addition, the Department does\nnot expand disclosure requirements to seat fees or adjacent seat fees more generally, as requested\nby some commenters, for the reasons discussed in section E (3)(d).\n(d) Consideration of Additional Ancillary Services\n(i) Seat Selection\nProposal: The Department explained in the NPRM its tentative view that “disclosure of\nan advance seat assignment fee at the beginning of a booking process is generally not needed\nbecause airlines are required to provide a seat with the cost of the air transportation.”97\n93 See Fall 2023 Unified Agenda for rulemaking titled “Family Seating in Air Transportation” (RIN 2105-AF15) at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AF15.\n94 See https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/family-seating/June-2022-notice.\nThat notice was issued in response to section 2309 of the FAA Extension, Safety and Security Act of 2016, which\nrequired DOT to review U.S. airline family seating policies and, if appropriate, establish a policy directing air\ncarriers to establish policies enabling a child 13 or under to be seated next to an accompany family member, subject\nto certain limitations.\n95 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-family-seating-dashboard.\n96 See https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-03/Bill_Family%20Seating%20Proposal_final.pdf.\n97 87 FR 63726.\nComments: Comments from some ticket agents and groups representing consumers,\nalong with a few individual consumers, requested that the Department consider all seating fees to\nbe critical, not only the fees for family seating as proposed. Some of those commenters identified\nadditional groups of passengers for whom adjacent seat assignments are, in their view, critical.\nFor example, Amadeus stated that adjacent seating fees may be critical for caregivers or family\nmembers of individuals with disabilities or the elderly. Travel Tech similarly identified\nindividuals traveling with the elderly as well as “a newly-wed couple on a 17-hour honeymoon\nflight or business partners who need to sit together to work during the flight.” The U.S. PIRG\nEducation Fund expressed its support for “up-front disclosure of adjacent seating fees involving\nadult relatives, friends or colleagues.”\nIn addition, some of these commenters identified reasons that consumers may wish to\nselect their seats when traveling alone. Among those commenters, Travel Tech stated that this\nmay include “passengers who need to sit near the front of the plane to make a connecting flight\nor passengers who need to be near the restroom for health reasons.” FlyersRights commented\nthat consumers may want to select seats to have more legroom or to sit near the front of the plane\nor an emergency exit. GBTA stated that seat selection could be considered critical for business\ntravelers.\nOn the other hand, AARP agreed with the Department’s preliminary assessment in the\nNPRM that disclosure of general seat selection fees at the beginning of the booking process was\nnot critical. Instead of requiring disclosure of seating fees, AARP requested that DOT require a\nclear disclosure “wherever advance seat selections are made available, that consumers do not\nneed to pay an additional fee unless they want to reserve a particular seat.” AARP recommended\nthis addition to reduce consumer confusion, explaining that “customers are often provided with a\nlimited range of seats to choose from, many or all of which require a fee to reserve” and “may\nbelieve that there are no ‘free’ seats available and may purchase an advance seat reservation out\nof concern that they will not be provided with a seat.”\nAs discussed above, airlines and other industry commenters raised concerns about the\ncosts and technological challenges of displaying dynamic seat fees in the context of the\nDepartment’s family seating proposal. These concerns would be equally applicable to required\ndisclosure of adjacent seating fees or individual seating fess more generally. In addition,\nconsistent with its comments on family seating fees, American Airlines specifically asked the\nDepartment not to expand its list of covered critical ancillary fees to include seating fees more\ngenerally.\nDOT Response: The Department has considered the comments stating that seating fees\nare critical to consumers purchasing decisions. Given that the cost of air transportation includes a\nseat and the lack of clarity about the importance of seat selection fees to consumers, the\nDepartment is not requiring carriers or ticket agents to disclose seating fees as required critical\nancillary service fees in this final rule. In making this determination, the Department also took\ninto account the concerns raised by industry commenters about the challenges of displaying\ndynamic seating fees discussed in section E (3)(c). The Department intends to monitor this issue\nfor possible future action if warranted. Regarding passengers with disabilities, the Department\nnotes that carriers are already required to provide seating accommodations that meet passengers’\ndisability-related needs under the Air Carrier Access Act and its implementing regulation, 14\nCFR part 382. These required accommodations include an adjoining seat for a personal care\nattendant who performs a function for a passenger with a disability that is not required to be\nperformed by airline personnel, a reader for a passenger who is blind or has low vision, an\ninterpreter for a passenger who is deaf or hard-of-hearing, or a safety assistant, if needed.\nFinally, the Department agrees with AARP that the option to purchase seats could\nconfuse consumers, who may think that a seat purchase is necessary. The Department has\ndetermined that it is a deceptive practice in violation of section 41712 for a carrier or ticket agent\nto fail to disclose that the purchase of a seat is not required for travel, particularly when\nconsumers are provided seats from which to choose where many, if not all, of those seats require\na fee to reserve. Without a clear disclosure, a reasonable consumer being offered seats to reserve\nwhere many of these seats must be purchased would be misled to believe that an advance seat\nassignment purchase is required to have a confirmed seat on the flight. The lack of disclosure\nthat consumers will be assigned a seat without additional payment is material as this omission is\nlikely to result in consumers unnecessarily paying a fee for a seat. Accordingly, this final rule\nrequires airlines and ticket agents to make the following disclosure clearly and conspicuously\nwhen a consumer is offered a seat selection for a fee: “A seat is included in your fare. You are\nnot required to purchase a seat assignment to travel. If you decide to purchase a ticket and do not\nselect a seat prior to purchase, a seat will be provided to you without additional charge when you\ntravel.”\n(ii) Other Ancillary Services\nProposal: The Department did not propose ancillary services, beyond transporting a first\nchecked, second checked, and/or carry-on bag, changing or canceling a reservation, and\nobtaining adjacent seating when traveling with a young child, to be critical. However, the\nDepartment sought comment on whether the ancillary services proposed to be critical in the\nNPRM should be expanded or limited.\nComments: Airline commenters generally opposed expanding the ancillary services to be\nconsidered critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision. The Department received only limited\nsupport for adding other specific ancillary fees to the list of ancillary services proposed to be\ncovered as critical in the NPRM. A few individual commenters asked the Department to include\nfees for food and a drink as well as in-flight wi-fi as critical ancillary service fees. In addition,\nGBTA stated that wi-fi and priority boarding could be considered critical for business travelers.\nFinally, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association asked that the rule be expanded to cover all\ngeneral aviation parking fees and the location of parking aprons at airports. Comments\nsuggesting the Department limit the ancillary services proposed to be critical are discussed in\nsection E (3)(d)(iii).\nDOT Response: The Department declines to expand in this final rule the list of specific\ncritical ancillary fees beyond those identified in its proposal as the record does not support\nconsidering fees for food, drinks, wi-fi, priority boarding, or parking fees as critical ancillary\nservice fees as suggested by a few commenters. As discussed in the next section, the Department\nmay determine that additional ancillary fees are critical after notice and an opportunity for\ncomment. The Department maintains the existing requirement that airlines must disclose the fees\nfor all ancillary services on their websites. Carriers and ticket agents are encouraged to provide\nconsumers with a clear and conspicuous link to this existing website during the booking process\nbefore ticket purchase. Airlines will continue to be allowed to provide the fees for ancillary\nservices, aside from baggage, in a range on this page. Consumers will be provided the specific\nfees that apply to them for all critical ancillary services when the fare and schedule information\nis provided following an itinerary search.\n(iii) Future Ancillary Services\nProposal: The Department solicited comment on whether its proposed list of critical\nancillary fees should, among other things, address future adoption by airlines of additional\nancillary service fees. The Department also asked how to ensure their disclosure to the extent\nthat they are of critical importance to consumers.\nComments: Multiple consumer groups asked the Department to require airlines and ticket\nagents to display additional ancillary service fees in the future to the extent that the fees become\nmore prevalent or are of particular importance to consumers. FlyersRights suggested the\nDepartment require carriers and ticket agents to display any fee that comprises two percent of all\nreporting carriers’ revenue or five percent of any single airline’s revenue, stating that its proposal\nwas intended to address its concern that “airlines may innovate new ways to break up the base\nfare into additional ancillary fees.” Similarly, a joint comment from multiple groups representing\nconsumers asked the Department to require disclosure of fees that exceed two percent of a\ncovered entity’s revenue according to BTS reporting and to adopt a regular review schedule to\nperiodically update the covered ancillary fees with feedback from consumer advocates. In\naddition, multiple State attorneys general requested that the Department adopt an open-ended\nprovision requiring disclosure of “fees associated with any products or services that a reasonable\ntraveler might foreseeably consider necessary.”\nOn the other hand, American Airlines opposed any expansion of the list of critical\nancillary fees from the NPRM. It stated that expanding the list would “further complicate the\nsearch queries, slowing the return of search results and cluttering displays” and provide minimal,\nif any, benefit to consumers. American Airlines asked the Department to rely on enforcement\nactions, rather than regulation, to address any innovations in ancillary fees that result in\nsignificant consumer complaints.\nDOT Response: Based on the comments received, the Department has not identified any\nfees beyond fees for transporting a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag\nand fees for changing and cancelling a ticket that are currently critical to consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions. The Department agrees with those commenters who stated that the Department should\nhave a method for regulating fee transparency for any ancillary services critical to consumers’\npurchasing decisions in the future. The Department disagrees, however, with those commenters\nwho suggested that the Department should establish a fixed interval to reevaluate the fees for\ncritical ancillary services. The Department receives regular feedback from stakeholders,\nincluding through the ACPAC, and monitors trends in consumer complaints filed with the\nDepartment. If these or other sources suggest that disclosure of additional ancillary services fees\nearly in the purchasing process is needed based on evolving industry practices, the Department\ncan provide notice and take comment at that time. The regularity with which the Department\nhears from stakeholder groups renders it unnecessary to establish a fixed time interval for re-\nevaluating ancillary fees.\nThe Department is also not persuaded by comments urging the Department to require\ndisclosure of ancillary fees that reach a certain threshold of airline revenue because carriers could\ndesign their fee structures in a manner to avoid any pre-established threshold. In this final rule,\nthe Department is not limiting ancillary services that are critical to those that meet a certain\nthreshold but instead adopting a definition of critical ancillary service that includes “any other\nservices determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.”\nMultiple State attorneys general also recommended establishing an open-ended provision when\ndefining critical ancillary fee. This final rule differs from their recommendation in that it\nprovides the public an opportunity for comment before the Department delineates additional\ncritical ancillary fees. The Department believes that effective and meaningful public engagement\nbefore determining additional ancillary services that are critical will lead to a better result.\n(4) Methods for Disclosing Critical Ancillary Service Fees and Policies\n(a) Website Disclosure of Fees\nProposal: The Department proposed to require that the fees for ancillary services that are\ncritical to a consumer’s purchasing decision be disclosed the first time that an airfare is displayed\nto consumers using airlines’ or ticket agents’ websites. More specifically, the Department\nproposed to require airlines and ticket agents disclose the first and second checked bag fees, the\ncarry-on bag fee, the change and cancellation fees and the family seating fee at the first point in a\nsearch process where a fare and schedule is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary.\nThe Department further proposed to prohibit display of fees for critical ancillary services by\nlinks and rollovers but requested comment on whether to allow these methods.\nThe Department further proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to indicate that a\nparticular fare category prohibits the checking of a bag or the carriage of a carry-on bag, if that is\nthe case, and any applicable penalty to transport the item, whenever fare and schedule\ninformation is provided during the itinerary search process. The Department also proposed to\nrequire carriers and ticket agents to disclose whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed,\nwhich could be provided via a pop-up or link adjacent to the pertinent change or cancellation fee.\nComments: Industry commenters expressed near-universal opposition to the requirement\nto display fees for critical ancillary services without the use of links or rollovers when an airline\nor ticket agent first provides schedule and fare information in response to an itinerary search.\nThese commenters expressed concerns about the costs, technological feasibility, and impacts on\nwebsite clarity and function if airlines and ticket agents are required to display all proposed\ncritical ancillary fees (first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag, ticket changes\nand cancellations, and family seating) without the use of links or rollovers when airlines and\nticket agents first provide schedule and fare information.\nMany industry commenters stated that display of all critical ancillary fee information\nrequired under the proposal on a single page without the use links or rollovers would result in\nairlines and ticket agents displaying fewer itinerary results and would overcrowd webpages. For\nexample, Frontier Airlines stated that under existing regulations, it could display four or five\nitinerary options on the first page of search results, but estimated that under the proposal, it\nwould only be able to display one or two results per page. Frontier Airlines further expressed\nconcern that crowded displays would block out or minimize information that it views as more\nrelevant to consumers, including additional flight options and base fares. Similarly, United\nAirlines estimated that it would be able to display only half of the number of flight options to\nconsumers under the proposal compared with its current website. Booking Holdings stated that a\nfirst-page display requirement for all ancillary fees proposed could reduce the number of\nitinerary results it could display on a single page from 12 under existing regulations to only one\nor two. Booking Holdings expressed concern that the NPRM’s proposal to require carriers or\nticket agents to display all critical ancillary fees when fare and schedule information is first\nprovided would result in consumers spending additional time scrolling or “giving up” on their\nsearch and selecting a less optimal flight than they would under existing disclosures. Finally, the\nU.S. Travel Association stated that, under the proposal, customers would need to scroll through\nmultiple pages of results, increasing the time needed to consider available ticket options.\nMany industry commenters, including Frontier Airlines, Google, Booking Holdings, and\nothers explained or provided visual displays of how search results would appear on their\nwebsites under the proposal in written comments or at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public\nhearing. For example, Google provided an example where both vertical and horizontal scrolling\nwas needed to show all ancillary fee information proposed at the first page of search results.\nAmadeus also testified at the hearing that providing all critical ancillary fees required by the\nproposal at the first point in the search process where schedule and fare information is provided\nwould reduce the number of flight options that could be displayed and, correspondingly, reduce\nthe inter-brand competition that the indirect channel provides.\nIn addition, industry commenters raised concerns that, in their view, displaying all\nrequired ancillary fees at the first page of search results would slow website loading times\nsignificantly and degrade the consumer experience, resulting in consumers abandoning carrier\nand ticket agent websites. For example, American Airlines estimated that its current search takes\nthree to five seconds to process and load but believes displaying all proposed critical ancillary\nfees on the first page would take 45 seconds to process and load. In addition, Spirit Airlines\nstated that providing all proposed ancillary fees would take seven times as long to load as its\ncurrent site and could require nine minutes of transaction time. Further, United Airlines\nexpressed concern about the effect that slower loading times would have on sales, stating that\nhalf of consumers abandon websites that take more than six seconds to load and over 50 percent\nexpect a website to load in three seconds or less. At the Department’s March 30, 2023, hearing,\nIATA cited studies stating that for every second of loading performance, there is an equivalent\ndrop in customer presence and sales. Booking Holdings stated that “the calls for data under the\nproposal could potentially be in the hundreds of thousands (especially for itinerary results that\ninclude multiple carriers or multiple passengers),” and, while its current system runs similar\nqueries, it does so only “after a passenger selects a flight option, thus reducing the search queries\nto that one flight itinerary, instead of thousands of potential flight itineraries.” In addition, Travel\nTech commented that every second added to website load times results in a seven percent loss in\nsales and 11 percent fewer page views.\nFurther, industry commenters stated that the proposed rule would require airlines and\nticket agents to provide ancillary fee information at a time that is not optimal for consumer\ndecision making and that the timing and method for displaying ancillary fees is best left to\nindustry expertise. Among those commenters, Spirit Airlines commented that it conducted a\nsurvey of consumers who abandoned booking and found that less than one percent abandoned\nthe booking path because bag prices were not displayed at the beginning of search, which it\nstated demonstrates that “[a]lmost all customers who decide not to fly Spirit are unbothered by\nancillary fees being provided later in the booking path.” Further, Spirit Airlines stated that it\nshowed a sample web display complying with the NPRM to “independent testers,” who preferred\nSpirit’s current site and stated that they preferred to select the flight first and then select from\nbaggage and seating options. Air Canada stated that its current practice of providing consumers\nwith a full price breakdown of all charges on a summary page before booking is “more\ninformative and useful for consumers” than the Department’s proposal because it lists all\ncharges, not only those ancillary fees that the Department deems critical. In addition, Booking\nHoldings represented that its customers prefer concise information at the first page of search\nresults and that ancillary fee information is more helpful after consumers select a specific\nitinerary. A4A testified that display of ancillary fees at the time of first search could confuse\nconsumers that such fees are mandatory and cause consumers to abandon their travel due to the\nperceived expense or to purchase ancillary services that are unnecessary for their travel. Further,\nNACA stated that providing ancillary fee information at the time fare and schedule information\nis first provided would overwhelm ULCC consumers, adding that selecting one ancillary at a\ntime makes the booking process easier and that the unbundled model “inherently requires\nenhanced disclosure and education, which the ULCCs already provide.” NACA also noted that\nE.O. 14036 instructed the Department to consider initiating a rulemaking to ensure disclosure of\nancillary fee information, including change and cancellation fees, “at the time of ticket\npurchase,” but it did not require the Department to initiate a rulemaking or to require disclosure\nat the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight\nitinerary.\nGoogle provided some statistical data related to its position that baggage fees are more\nrelevant to consumers later in the booking process. Google reported that 1.3 percent of\nconsumers conducting a search on Google Flights use a feature allowing them to integrate bag\nfees into the displayed costs for flights before a specific itinerary has been selected. At the\nDepartment’s public hearing in March 2023, Google testified that this statistic supported its\nposition that baggage information may be relevant to consumers later in the search process,\nrather than at the point of initial search. Google also provided the results of a study of U.S.\nconsumers it conducted in 2018. It cited this study as evidence that consumers prefer to think\nabout baggage fees later in the booking process, with 21 percent of consumers in the survey\nstating that they start thinking about baggage while searching for flights but 23 percent of\nconsumers in the survey stating that do not start thinking about baggage until the time of flight\nbooking. In addition, according to the results reported by Google, 19 percent of consumers\n“decide about baggage” at the time of flight search, but another 35 percent do not decide about\nbaggage until the time of flight booking.\nA4A provided testimony on the costs of the proposal at the Department’s March 30,\n2023, public hearing, stating that the proposal to require display of all critical ancillary fees on\nthe first page of search results would require an overhaul of the entire air fare “ecosystem.” A4A\nfurther testified that the costs would be exorbitant and exceed the technical capacity of airline\nsystems, which it added are not currently built to retrieve and display the amount of fee\ninformation required. Many other industry commenters provided similar testimony or written\ncomments. Additional discussion of the economic impacts of the final rule is provided in the\nRegulatory Notices section of this document.\nSome industry commenters also raised specific concerns with the technical ability to\ncalculate and display fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag at\nthe first page where airlines or ticket agents provide fare and schedule information in response to\na search without the use of rollovers or links. IATA stated that this proposed requirement is\n“unreasonable” and added that the calculation of baggage fees is “not trivial, particularly with\nmulti-carrier itineraries, and neither airlines nor agents today are capable of undertaking the\ncalculation on what could be more than 100 itineraries presented on an initial search page.”\nIATA added that, in its view, the costs of the requirement would outweigh any benefits.\nSimilarly, Air Canada stated that the calculation of baggage fees “is a complex process,”\nparticularly for multi-carrier itineraries, and that the development of “ancillary service packages\nor subscriptions that allow passengers to, among other services, have unlimited checked baggage\nafter paying an annual fee or the bundling of baggage fees with those of meals or Wi-Fi” would\nmake displaying baggage fees on the first page of search results more challenging.\nA few industry commenters recommended that, if the Department decides to require\nairlines and ticket agents to display any ancillary fees when fare and schedule information is first\nprovided, it should do so only for the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on\nbaggage. For example, Travel Tech stated that if the Department chose to adopt “any prescriptive\nrules,” those requirements “should be limited to requiring that only critical baggage fees . . . be\ndisplayed on the first search results page.” Travel Tech added that “[b]y so limiting the amount\nof information required to be displayed on the first search results page, DOT can largely avoid\nthe information overload and page clutter problems” identified in its comments. Skyscanner\nmade similar comments, stating that it recommended “that no display requirement mandating a\nspecific location for the display of ancillary fee information should be imposed,” but continuing\nthat “if such a rule is imposed, it should require that only baggage fees be displayed on the first\npage of ticket search results.” Skyscanner added that its recommendation was based on its\ninternal user research indicating “that many users are much more concerned about baggage\nallowances and fees than any single other type of ancillary fee,” with 84 percent indicating “it\nwas important to know whether a ticket price includes checked bags.”\nIndustry commenters, including IATA, also stated that the complexity of calculating\nmultiple change and cancellation fees for multiple itineraries would be technologically infeasible\n(particularly for multi-carrier itineraries), result in significantly slow website loading, and be\nextremely costly to implement. For example, IATA commented that the cost of calculating\nmultiple change and cancellation fees “for every itinerary at the initial search cannot be justified in\nterms of search time saved by passengers.”\nInstead of first page display of fees for critical ancillary services in text form, industry\ncommenters generally requested more flexible display of these fees. Alternatives recommended\nby these commenters included the Department allowing the display of fee information later in the\nbooking process; the use of links, pop-ups, rollovers, and other methods; and the display of fee\ninformation outside of the booking process. For example, individual airlines also recommended\nthat the Department allow links and rollovers. United Airlines suggested that the Department\npermit disclosures through links, pop-ups, banners, landing pages, and acknowledgements.\nAmerican Airlines explained that links and rollovers “would allow consumers to access the fee\ninformation as needed on an individual basis and avoid overwhelming consumers by flooding\nthem with information at the first shopping point.”\nSimilarly, ticket agent representatives such as Travel Tech recommended allowing\ncritical ancillary fee information to be displayed using pop-ups and links. Booking Holdings\nrecommended that the Department allow airlines and ticket agents to display fees by hovering\nover or clicking a link or allowing disclosures on the second page of the booking process after a\nflight is selected. Further, Google stated that more flexibility in display would better serve\nconsumers, and expounded that rollovers, hyperlinks, and pop-ups would give disclosures to\nconsumers in a readable and customizable format. Hopper and other commenters advocated for\ndisplay at any time before ticket purchase. At the Department’s March 2023 public hearing,\nAmadeus advocated for allowing more flexible displays such as hyperlinks, mouseovers, pop-\nups, expandable text, and other shortcuts to facilitate faster and cost-efficient implementation\nacross the industry. According to Amadeus, those methods help avoid performance issues and\nreduce the number of transactions, extending computing resources and improving the time\nnecessary to provide search results. In addition, Air Canada asked the Department to clarify\nwhen “fare and schedule information is first provided” if it chose to finalize the proposal. The\ncarrier also asked the Department to allow carriers to display required ancillary fee disclosures\n“external to the booking process.”\nSpecific to change and cancellation fee disclosures, Amadeus asked the Department to\nallow display of minimum and maximum change and cancellation fees, rather than all potentially\napplicable change and cancellation fees. IATA suggested that carriers could include a link on the\ninitial search page to clear language on whether the carrier imposes change or cancellation fees\nand what factors are considered in setting that fee. Skyscanner recommended that DOT require\ndisplay of one change fee and not on the first page of search results.\nIn their comments and public hearing testimony, multiple groups representing consumers\nexpressed support for the Department’s proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to display\ncritical ancillary service fees when fare and schedule information are first displayed in response\nto a consumer search. FlyersRights commented that the proposal would achieve better price\ntransparency for consumers. In addition, at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing,\nFlyersRights testified that current market conditions reward those airlines that hide the ball at the\nexpense of more transparent airlines and asserted that one airline’s website requires many clicks\nfrom the first page where schedule and fare information is displayed before a consumer reaches\nthe web page where static baggage fees are disclosed. Further, a joint comment from multiple\ngroups representing consumers supported the Department’s proposal to prohibit the use of links\nand rollovers to display fees for critical ancillary services. The U.S. PIRG Education Fund added\nthat in its view, fee information should be provided before beginning the booking process, not\nonce it has begun, and expressed concerns about drip pricing. Finally, the ACPAC Chair,\nrepresenting state and local governments, stated at the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting that\nthe Department’s proposal was “fair” in permitting airlines and ticket agents to display baggage\npolicies, but not baggage fees, in links and pop-ups based on her belief that the average flyer\nbetter understands what constitutes an oversized bag than the actual bag fee amounts.\nA few organizations representing consumers, however, expressed concern about the\npotential for consumer confusion under this aspect of the Department’s proposal. AARP was\ngenerally supportive of the Department’s proposal, noting that not providing critical ancillary fee\ninformation when a fare is provided would inhibit the ability of consumers “to make an informed\ndecision about which price and itinerary combination best suits their need,” and adding that if\nfees are disclosed at the end of the booking process “that consumer is much less likely to re-start\nthe process of comparison shopping, leading to a less than optimal outcome.” But AARP further\nrecommended that any “disclosures must be made in such a way as to minimize visual clutter\nand confusion and be easy to read and comprehend.” In addition, Travelers United testified at the\nDepartment’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that more disclosure was preferrable but also\nexpressed concern in its written comment that “DOT is seriously underestimating the technology\nneeded for this NPRM as it stands now. Perhaps limiting it to only baggage may provide enough\ninformation to deal with today’s competition and prepare for the coming age of AI [artificial\nintelligence].”\nIndividuals also expressed differing views. For example, one individual stated that how\nand when airlines display the elements of a total fare should be left to airlines and suggested that\nconsumers could purchase from a different airline should a particular airline provide a confusing\ndisplay. However, another took the position that baggage fees are the most important charges to\nconsumers and displays with this information would not confuse consumers or be excessive. This\ncommenter noted that airlines already provide first and business class fares that many consumers\nwill never use.\nThe ACPAC solicited information on the appropriate timing of disclosure for critical\nancillary service fees at its December 2022 meeting. At that meeting, the ACPAC member\nrepresenting consumers observed that to minimize problems with drip pricing, consumers should\nhave information on critical ancillary service fees early in the process. However, he also noted\nthat providing early information on all ancillary fees could lead to consumers being\noverwhelmed. Specifically, he opined that baggage fees, change/cancellation fees, and seat\nreservation fees were the biggest “pain points” for consumers that should be disclosed early.\nSimilarly, a consumer advocacy organization suggested that fees for carry-on and checked bags,\nas well as change/cancellation fees and on-time/cancellation statistics, should be displayed on the\nfirst page where a price is quoted.98\nAt its January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC recommended that the Department adopt\nits proposal to require change and cancellation fee information be displayed during the itinerary\nsearch process and not just before ticket purchase. The ACPAC member representing consumers\nnoted that change and cancellation fees impact consumers’ buying decisions when shopping for\nan airline ticket, and that if the disclosures are not made early in the purchase process, consumers\nwould not have change and cancellation fee information on all the options available to them\nwhen making a purchasing decision. The ACPAC member representing airlines expressed his\nconcern that disclosure of the baggage and change and cancellation fees during the itinerary\nsearch process would present too much information to consumers and advocated for links or pop-\nups to be permitted for the display of baggage and change and cancellation fee information if\nthere is a requirement to display such fee information.\nThe ACPAC also recommended at its January 12, 2023, meeting that the Department\nrequire ticket agents and metasearch entities to display airlines’ change and cancellation fee\ninformation in a consistent manner to avoid creating confusion for consumers. The ACPAC\n98 Presentation of FlyersRights, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0046.\nmember representing airports explained that a ticket agent should not be allowed to display an\nitinerary for one airline that shows the total change or cancellation fees for a group of travelers,\nwhile the itinerary for another airline shows the change or cancellation fees on a per passenger\nbasis. Travel Tech commented that the ACPAC recommendation goes beyond the proposals of\nthe NPRM and fails to recognize that ticket agents do not receive data from airlines consistently\nand lack the resources to implement this recommendation.\nRegarding the Department’s proposal that consumers be informed when fare and\nschedule information is provided if the fare category does not permit traveling with a first\nchecked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag or permit changing or cancelling a\nreservation, various commenters expressed support for it and stated that clear disclosure upfront\nof these prohibitions is necessary to avoid consumer harm. Southwest Airlines explained that\nbasic economy fares are increasingly common and likely to appeal to occasional, less savvy\nbudget travelers, making early disclosure that these tickets cannot be changed or canceled and\nthat passengers cannot travel with a carry-on bag or checked bag if that is the case especially\nnecessary. Southwest Airlines added that because the least expensive basic economy tickets\noften are at the top of search results, it is particularly important to provide complete and timely\nnotice of such restrictions on all distribution channels. FlyersRights and Travelers United\nrecommended that the Department require a clear disclosure for fares that prohibit ticket changes\nor cancellations, similar to the disclosure proposed for fares that prohibit baggage.\nDOT Response: This final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to clearly and\nconspicuously disclose accurate fees for all critical ancillary services (i.e., a first checked bag, a\nsecond checked bag, a carry-on bag, ticket change, and ticket cancellation) on the airline’s or\nticket agent’s website at the time fare and schedule information is initially provided when a\nconsumer conducts a search for air transportation. The Department acknowledges the concern of\nairline commenters that ancillary packages or subscriptions that allow passengers to have\nunlimited checked baggage for an annual fee or bundle baggage fees with other ancillary services\nsuch as wi-fi or food would make displaying baggage fees on the first page of search results\nmore challenging. The Department is clarifying that, while airlines and ticket agents must\ndisclose the standalone fees for critical ancillary services required under this rule, they are not\nrequired to disclose the ancillary service packages or bundles that include one or more critical\nancillary services but may do so if they choose.\nThe Department disagrees with those commenters who stated that the Department should\nallow fee information for critical ancillary services to be displayed later in the booking process,\nafter consumers have already spent time selecting an itinerary based on incomplete fee\ninformation. The challenges cited by Air Canada and IATA that industry faces in calculating\nbaggage fees favors requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose these fees to consumers,\nrather than placing the burden on consumers to make complex calculations. Regarding Air\nCanada’s request for clarification of the meaning of “when fare and schedule information is first\nprovided,” that phrase means the first point at which a fare is quoted for a particular flight\nitinerary. This first point will typically be the first page of search results provided in response to\na consumer’s itinerary search. The Department disagrees with A4A that displaying baggage fee\ninformation when schedule and fare information is first provided will confuse consumers that\npayment of such fees is mandatory. Many industry commenters touted their ability to design\ninnovative and clear web displays, and the Department expects that the industry will use those\nskills to meet the disclosure requirements of this rule in a manner that mitigates the potential for\nconsumer confusion. The Department acknowledges NACA’s statement that E.O. 14036 does\nnot require the Department to mandate disclosure of critical ancillary fees at the first point in the\nsearch process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. For the reasons\ndiscussed in this preamble, however, the Department has determined that disclosure of critical\nancillary fees at that point is necessary to mitigate unfair and deceptive practices and that the\nrequirements in this final rule are consistent with the E.O.\nThe Department does not adopt the alternatives to providing itinerary- and passenger-\nspecific change and cancellation fees recommended by some industry commenters, such as\nrequiring airlines and ticket agents to display the factors used by the airline to set the relevant\nchange and cancellation fees (rather than the fees themselves), a single change or cancellation\nfee (rather than all change and cancellation fees), or minimum and maximum change and\ncancellation fees. Each of those recommended alternatives would result in disclosure that is\ninsufficiently precise to advise consumers of the true cost of selecting a particular itinerary.\nIn response to the ACPAC recommendation, the Department notes that this final rule\ndoes not mandate change and cancellation fee disclosures to be displayed in a consistent manner\nor use standardized definitions. The Department is of the view that, so long as the required\ninformation is presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, there is no identified consumer harm\nfrom ticket agents developing their own displays. The Department believes that the requirement\nin this rule to disclose a summary of the applicable change and cancellation policies will be\nsufficient to clarify any potential inconsistencies in the presentation of such fees. Should the\nDepartment determine in the future that a problem regarding the consistency of critical ancillary\nservice fee disclosures exist, the Department may revisit this issue. The requests by AARP and\nothers that the Department work to eliminate change and cancellation fees are beyond the scope\nof this rulemaking.\nThe Department acknowledges concerns raised by commenters about the cost and\ntechnological feasibility of providing all critical ancillary fee information in text form where an\nairline or ticket agent first provides fare and schedule information in response to a consumer’s\nitinerary search. To address these concerns, the Department is providing additional flexibility for\nticket agents and airlines in how they disclose the required fees. This final rule requires that fees\nbe “clearly and conspicuously” disclosed but does not limit the display of critical ancillary fees\nto only static text next to the fare. While the final rule continues to prohibit display of fees for\ncritical ancillary services by links, the Department is not prohibiting the use of pop-ups or other\nmethods to avoid the page clutter problems that commenters identified. To further explain this\nrequirement, the final rule defines “clear and conspicuous” to mean that a disclosure is difficult\nto miss (i.e., easily noticeable), easily understandable by ordinary consumers, and presented in a\nmanner that allows ordinary consumers to determine the true cost of travel. In other words, it\nshould be readily apparent to a consumer that fee information is available, the process for calling\nup such information should be uncomplicated, and the fee information should be understandably\npresented. Also, the fees themselves and how to access them should not be hidden or involve\nsignificant effort to ascertain by the consumer. Further, the consumer’s booking process should\nnot be disrupted in such a way that causes the consumer to have to start over their search process\nfrom the beginning or to lose their location on the page being viewed. The rule prohibits airlines\nand ticket agents from displaying critical ancillary fees by hyperlink because displaying fees in\nthat manner would disrupt the consumer’s search.\nTo evaluate whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous, the Department intends to\nconsider the clarity of the fee disclosure (whether in text or through a pop-up, in expandable text,\nor by other means); the font size used for the disclosure compared with other text on the page;\nand the placement of the disclosure on the page, among other information. Provided that the fees\nfor critical ancillary services are disclosed in a manner that meets the regulatory criteria of clear\nand conspicuous and not provided by hyperlink, airlines and ticket agents have the flexibility to\ndisplay or disclose these fees through various methods, including in text form on the page with\nthe fare, through a pop-up, or other method that does not navigate the consumer away from the\npage and place on the page being viewed at the time the user action is taken, or through\nexpandable text on the page where the fare is displayed. The Department concludes that these\nmodifications from the proposal will better enable industry to use innovative web design to\ndisplay fees in a manner that is technologically feasible while still ensuring that consumers are\nprovided with critical information about the true cost of travel at the time of itinerary search.\nGiven the increased flexibility afforded by this final rule compared to the initial proposal, as\nsought by many commenters, the Department concludes that compliance should be feasible and\nreduce the potential for slow loading times or cluttered or confusing displays for consumers.\nAlso, as proposed, the Department is requiring that airlines and ticket agents disclose to\nconsumers if a particular fare category prohibits the checking of a first or second checked bag or\nthe carriage of a carry-on bag and display the penalty, if applicable, for carrying on or checking\nthe item. The Department is also adopting its proposal to require carriers and ticket agents to\ndisclose upfront whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed. The Department agrees\nwith commenters who stated that it is particularly important for airlines and ticket agents to\ndisclose that a given fare prohibits changes and cancellations if that is the case. Under this final\nrule, airlines and ticket agents are required to disclose that a particular fare category prohibits a\nfirst checked bag, a second checked bag, a carry-on bag, ticket change, or ticket cancellation, if\nthat is the case, when fare and schedule information is provided during an itinerary search. The\ndisclosures must be clear and not mislead consumers into believing that the fee for a particular\nfare category is zero, when in fact a bag or ticket change or cancellation is simply prohibited.\nFinally, we note that this rule’s disclosure requirements for critical ancillary fees and\npolicies must also be reflected in carriers’ customer service plans. By adding an assurance in\ntheir plans, carriers commit to consumers that they will meet the minimum standards set forth in\nthis rule regarding the disclosure of critical ancillary fees and policies. This customer service\ncommitment is merely reinforcing new requirements imposed elsewhere in this final rule.\n(b) Website Disclosure of Policies\nDOT Proposal: The Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents disclose,\nalong with the fare and schedule information, the policies applicable to transporting a first\nchecked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on as well as changing and cancelling a\nreservation, taking into account the consumer’s passenger-specific information, if provided. For\nbaggage, the Department proposed that carriers and ticket agents must display the weight and\ndimension limitations that a carrier imposes for each checked and carry-on bag, with passenger-\nspecific adjustments if applicable. For ticket changes and cancellations, the Department proposed\nto require carriers and ticket agents provide a summary of the ticket change and cancellation\npolicies applicable to the consumer’s chosen itinerary and fare category, considering the\nconsumer’s passenger-specific information, if provided. The Department proposed to allow\ncarriers and ticket agents to display policy information for baggage, ticket changes, and ticket\ncancellations using links or pop-ups adjacent to the display of the pertinent fee.\nIn the NPRM, the Department explained that these brief policy summaries should include\nclear, adequate notice of the rules applicable to the chosen itinerary and fare category, including\nwhether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed (as well as when and in what circumstances\nthey are allowed), the form that refunds or airline credits may be provided (e.g., travel voucher or\na credit to the original form of payment), any prohibitions or conditions that may limit the ability\nto change or cancel a ticket, and other information. The Department did not propose specific\nrequirements for how carriers and ticket agents should address the need for passengers to pay a\nfare difference between the old and new ticket prices in the event of a change but requested\ncomment on that issue. The Department also asked about consumer confusion from the material\nchange in fare that occurs with many ticket changes being a larger component of the overall price\nrelative to the change fee itself.\nComments: Air Canada asked for additional clarification, including “whether baggage\nfees that must be displayed also include additional costs associated with those bags. For example,\nis it an obligation to display excess baggage and overweight fees or is it appropriate that these\nfees are charged at the airport when the baggage is dropped off?”\nOn the method of displaying baggage policy information, the ACPAC recommended that\nthe Department retain its proposal that pop-ups and links are acceptable for specific information\nabout size and dimension allowances for baggage in any final rule. At the January 12, 2023,\nACPAC meeting, the ACPAC Chair, who is the member representing state and local governments,\nstated that it should be acceptable to provide baggage size policies by link because the average\nflyer has an understanding of what constitutes an oversized bag. The member representing airports\nagreed, adding that much baggage comes in standard sizes. Travel Tech also supported this\nproposal.\nFor policies applicable to changes and cancellations, among industry commenters, IATA\nobjected to the requirement for air carriers and ticket agents to provide a brief summary of the\napplicable change and cancellation policy, stating that “[a]irlines are under no obligation to\nprovide passengers explanations as to why they are imposing fees on passengers who decide on\ntheir own not to use a particular ticket.” Representing consumers, FlyersRights asked the\nDepartment to require that airlines and ticket agents display information on whether any refund\nprovided would be as a cash or a cash equivalent, non-expiring travel credits or vouchers, or\nexpiring travel credits or vouchers, and whether those amounts would be for the entire ticket\nprice less the change or cancellation fee or discounted.\nThe Department received a few responses to its request for comment on the issue of fare\ndifferentials. Air Canada noted that most of the cost to change a flight would be due to the fare\ndifferential. Other commenters noted that, given that fare differentials may be a part of the cost\nto change tickets, it was not possible to disclose the full cost of a ticket change at the time of\nticket purchase, since the full cost may not be known until the consumer changes their ticket. In\naddition, Travelport stated that “fare differentials due to dynamic pricing are common\nknowledge,” and deemed a requirement to disclose that a fare differential may apply\n“unnecessary.” In contrast, FlyersRights requested that the Department require disclosure that a\nfare differential may apply and whether the airline or ticket agent would refund the fare\ndifference if the replacement flight was less costly than the originally purchased flight.\nRegarding the method of displaying policy information on ticket changes and\ncancellations, the ACPAC recommended that the Department retain its proposal that change or\ncancellation policy information may be displayed by links or pop-ups in any final rule. The\nACPAC also recommended that the Department provide greater clarification on the specific\nlocation rollovers or pop-ups should be placed for consumers to view additional change or\ncancellation policy information. Travel Tech commented that the Department should permit\ndisclosure of change and cancellation policies by links or pop-ups as proposed. In addition,\nTravel Tech opposed the ACPAC recommendation regarding the specific location rollovers or\npop-ups should be placed and asserted that the Department should allow flexibility instead.\nDOT Response: The Department largely maintains the proposed requirements for the\ndisclosure of baggage and ticket change and cancellation policies applicable to the itinerary, taking\ninto account the consumer’s passenger-specific information, if affirmatively provided.99\nThe Department is adopting its proposal requiring that the weight and dimension\nlimitations that the carrier imposes for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags be\ndisclosed, with passenger-specific adjustments, if applicable. The Department has determined\nthat the failure to provide weight and dimension information before ticket purchase is an unfair\npractice, as discussed in section D (1)(a). The Department is not requiring that airlines and ticket\nagents disclose the fees for excess and overweight baggage as part of the required disclosure on\nweight and dimension limitations.\nThe Department makes clear in this final rule that the disclosure of baggage, change, and\ncancellation policies must be accurate as well as clear and conspicuous. Unlike the fees\nthemselves, however, the Department allows as proposed the use of links for these policies.\nAllowing the option for airlines and ticket agents to provide these disclosures by hyperlink was\nrecommended by the ACPAC and supported by public comment. Further, to reduce screen\nclutter, the Department is allowing summaries of applicable baggage, change, and cancellation\npolicies to be disclosed any time before ticket purchase, rather than requiring them to be\ndisclosed contemporaneously with the fees as proposed. The Department is persuaded by\ncommenters that providing the policy information later in the purchasing process will not harm\nconsumers. The Department concludes that the requirement to provide these policies in a clear\n99 Passenger-specific requirements are discussed in section E (5).\nand conspicuous manner, as defined in this final rule and further explained in section E (4)(a) of\nthis preamble, provides adequate information regarding where and how baggage and change and\ncancellation policies must be disclosed, while maintaining flexibility for airlines and ticket\nagents to develop their own consumer-friendly displays.\nRegarding change and cancellation policy summaries, the Department disagrees with\nIATA’s interpretation of the NPRM proposal. The Department did not propose to require carriers\nto disclose “why they are imposing” change and cancellation fees, but instead proposed that\ncarriers and ticket agents should disclose, among other information, whether ticket changes and\ncancellations are permitted, the conditions under which change and cancellation fees would\napply, and the form of any refund provided. The Department is adopting this proposal in this\nfinal rule.\nMore specifically, given that the Department’s conclusion that change and cancellation\nfees are critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision, the Department is identifying in this final\nrule the types of information that must be included in the summaries of change and cancellation\npolicies. First, the Department agrees with those commenters who stated that it is particularly\nimportant for airlines and ticket agents to disclose that a given fare prohibits change and\ncancellations if that is the case (as discussed in section E 4(a)), and so this final rule requires any\nprohibitions or conditions that may limit a consumer’s ability to change or cancel a ticket to be\nclearly and conspicuously provided in the summary of the change or cancellation policy. In\naddition, the final rule requires, as suggested by FlyersRights, that airlines and ticket agents\ndisclose the form of the refund or credit that would be provided in the event a change or\ncancellation is permitted. Finally, the change and cancellation summary must include notice that\nthe consumer is responsible for any fare differential if that is the case. As noted by Air Canada, a\nlarge portion of the cost for a passenger to change their flight in many cases could be the fare\ndifferential. Given the potentially significant cost of fare differentials, the Department concludes\nthat it would be deceptive to disclose a change fee without also disclosing that the passenger may\nalso be required to pay the difference in fare. As such, the Department does not believe that this\ndisclosure is unnecessary, as urged by Travelport, and, accordingly, the final rule requires this\nadditional disclosure. Further, the Department agrees with FlyersRights that the airline or ticket\nagent must disclose whether it will refund the difference in fare if the consumer changes their\nflight and selects a less costly replacement flight. This disclosure must be provided in the change\npolicy. The Department has determined that the failure to provide the change and cancellation\npolicy information required by this rule before ticket purchase is an unfair and deceptive\npractice, as discussed in section D (1)(b).\n(c) Mobile Site and App Disclosure of Fees and Policies\nProposal: The Department proposed to require disclosure of fees and policies for\nancillary services critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision at the first point in a search\nprocess where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary on airlines’ and ticket\nagents’ websites, including mobile websites. In the NPRM, the Department noted that consumers\nincreasingly use mobile devices to book travel, and so it is important that the same disclosures\nprovided on airlines’ and ticket agents’ desktop websites are also provided on mobile websites.\nWhile the Department did not propose to require critical ancillary fee and policy disclosures on\nairlines’ and ticket agents’ mobile apps, it sought comment on whether to extend the proposal to\nmobile apps and whether there are any practical distinctions between information accessed on\nmobile websites and mobile apps.\nComments: Multiple commenters provided data through their written comments and at\nthe Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing regarding the frequency with which consumers\nbook air travel on mobile websites and apps. AELP testified that 70 percent of consumers\nresearch travel on mobile devices. IATA provided the same statistic in its comments and further\nnoted that 44 percent of online bookings were completed on mobile devices, citing a 2022 report.\nPriceline testified that more than half of its business is from mobile customers, Google stated that\n68 percent of its users browse on mobile devices, and Hopper reported that its entire business is\nconducted “exclusively through the Hopper mobile app.” A joint comment from multiple\nconsumer groups noted that the top five free travel apps that sell airline tickets through the Apple\noperating system, iOS, have a combined 13.6 million user ratings, demonstrating that such apps\nhave reached millions of consumers.\nIndustry commenters opposed both the proposed requirement that airlines and ticket\nagents disclose all critical ancillary fees at the first page of search results on mobile websites and\nthe extension of that proposal to cover mobile apps. These commenters noted that challenges\nwith screen clutter are particularly acute on mobile devices and apps, which have limited screen\nspace, and stated that the proposed requirement would likely limit the number of search results\nprovided or require excessive scrolling on mobile apps and websites. In addition, Air Canada\nasserted that ATPCO was never designed to work in conjunction with mobile apps and therefore\nthere is an inherent level of disconnect in the transferability of information between ATPCO and\nmobile apps. Further, Travel Tech stated that accommodating screen readers for individuals with\ndisabilities on mobile devices would be more difficult given the volume of information required\nat the first page of search results under the proposal.\nSome industry commenters, including Frontier Airlines, Campbell-Hill Aviation Group\n(on behalf of A4A), Sprit Airlines, and Google, provided visual illustrations to demonstrate the\nchallenges of displaying first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag fees, change and\ncancellation fees, and family seating fees on the first page of mobile search results. For example,\nin Google’s presentation at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing, it provided a\nsample mobile display it had created which it stated would require both horizontal and vertical\nscrolling for a consumer to see all ancillary fees required by the NPRM at the first page of search\nresults.\nA few commenters stated that challenges in displaying information on mobile devices\nwould only continue to grow with continued technological evolution. For example, Amadeus\ntestified that in the future more consumers will book air travel through mobile devices or other\ndevices, such as wearables, with very small screens that might provide search results in the form\nof a voice message. Similarly, IATA noted that consumers are “increasingly conducting ticket\nsearches via voice recognition, with the only major impediment being too much information to\nsort through.” IATA stated that a requirement that all ancillary fee data be provided on the initial\nsearch page would inhibit consumer-friendly innovation. Travelers United expressed concern\nabout the Department’s ability to adapt its rule to future technology such as artificial intelligence.\nThis comment observed that by the time the rule takes effect, “new technology will be leading us\nin a different direction.”\nAmerican Airlines and Hopper submitted comments addressing how the functionality of\nmobile devices differs from traditional desktop websites. American Airlines stated that carriers\nprovide similar functionalities for mobile devices as for desktop websites and that those mobile\nfunctionalities “allow the consumer to view or hide information at the consumer’s choosing,\neven if a mobile device does not have a cursor.” This comment further explained: “in lieu of\n‘hovering,’ [for mobile devices] American [Airlines] will provide a dropdown arrow which the\nconsumer can click to display or hide the relevant information. These dropdown arrows are\nfamiliar and intuitive to consumers and provide the same benefits as rollovers.” Hopper\ncommented that rollovers, hyperlinks, and non-adjacent disclosures are ineffective on mobile\nwebsites and apps, but other comparable methods can be implemented by travel agencies for\nmobile websites and apps if the final rule “is not overly proscriptive.” Hopper stated that “using\nexpandable native results boxes” is “an effective approach” for mobile devices.\nIndustry commenters suggested different approaches for whether and how the final rule’s\nrequirements should apply to mobile apps and websites. American Airlines favored applying the\nsame requirements to desktop and mobile displays, noting that different disclosures would be\ncostly to develop and “far more confusing for the consumers who would receive different\ndisclosures depending on the portal they use.” Other industry commenters asked the Department\nto either exclude mobile apps from the final rule entirely or to allow more flexibility or more\nlimited disclosures on mobile devices. For example, NACA recommended permitting links to\ncritical ancillary fee information on mobile apps given limited screen space. Air Canada asked\nthat DOT not extend the rule’s requirements to mobile apps, other than a possible disclosure that\n“additional fees may apply” or directing the passenger to the carrier’s website. Observing that\n“mobile apps are not scaled-down versions of desktop websites but rather use display formats\nthat are uniquely designed to make information more accessible,” Travel Tech asked DOT to\nexclude mobile apps from the final rule to allow engineers to develop innovative displays for\napps. Like Travel Tech, Hopper requested “flexibility for agents to design new and innovative\nmethods for serving their customers on mobile devices.” Hopper asked that both mobile websites\nand apps be excluded from any requirement to provide disclosure at the first page of search\nresults and that disclosure instead be required prior to the time of purchase for mobile devices\nand apps.\nAmong groups representing consumers, AARP and a joint comment from multiple\nconsumer groups supported covering mobile apps in the final rule. However, Travelers United\nexpressed concern about the possibility of screen clutter on mobile devices. The joint comment\nfrom multiple consumer groups urged the Department to cover mobile apps to avoid excluding\nfrom fee disclosures the millions of consumers who book flights via mobile apps. That comment\nfurther noted that “mobile apps are just as capable of disseminating airlines’ unfair and deceptive\ncommercial practices” as mobile websites or desktop websites and have expanded reach due to\npush notifications. Finally, this comment explained that many consumers, especially those who\nare younger or low income, are likely to rely on smartphones as their primary internet\nconnection, and so the final rule should cover mobile applications to avoid “disproportionately\nexclud[ing] these populations.” AARP suggested that DOT could allow opt-outs or links and\nrollovers for mobile devices.\nThe few individual commenters who addressed coverage of mobile apps recommended\ndifferent approaches. Individuals recommending that the Department cover mobile apps stated\nthat covering mobile apps was necessary given increased use of those apps by consumers, to\navoid misleading and confusing consumers by providing different information on various\nplatforms, and because mobile apps provide a more “accessible” interface for users than mobile\nwebsites. One individual commenter, however, expressed concern about screen clutter on mobile\napps due to the proposed requirement to display all critical ancillary fee data at the first page of\nsearch results.\nDOT Response: Under this final rule, airlines and ticket agents must provide the same\ndisclosures for critical ancillary service fees and policies on all online platforms. As commenters\nexplained, consumers now widely use mobile websites and apps to shop for and purchase air\ntransportation. The Department agrees with commenters who stated that it would be confusing to\nhave different critical ancillary fee requirements for mobile apps than for mobile and desktop\nwebsites. Further, the Department concludes that excluding airline and ticket agent apps from\nthis rule’s requirement to disclose ancillary fee data that the Department has determined is\ncritical to consumers’ purchasing decisions would not sufficiently protect consumers who use\nmobile apps to purchase air transportation.\nSeveral commenters noted that methods of consumer search are evolving to include\nwearable devices, artificial intelligence, and voice recognition technology. To adequately cover\ndesktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps, and other technologies in this final rule, the\nDepartment uses the term “online platform” This term is defined as “any interactive electronic\nmedium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer\nto search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent.”\nThe Department makes modifications from the proposal in this final rule that mitigate the\nconcerns raised by commenters about the volume of information required to be disclosed at the\nfirst point in the search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight\nitinerary. This final rule does not require airlines and ticket agents that sell air transportation to\ndisplay family seating fees, which the Department had proposed. In addition, while fees for\ncritical ancillary services must still be disclosed at the first point in the search process where a\nfare is provided in connection with a specific flight itinerary, this final rule provides significant\nflexibility to airlines and ticket agents regarding the method of displaying that information so\nlong as it is displayed in a clear and conspicuous manner and not by hyperlinks. This allowance\nincludes the option to use expandable native results boxes or dropdown arrows on mobile\nwebsites and apps, which as described in comments from American Airlines and Hopper, is the\ntype of flexibility that would permit airlines and ticket agents to produce innovative, consumer-\nfriendly ancillary fee displays without overwhelming consumers, unduly cluttering search\nresults, or limiting the number of search results. These same flexibilities apply to desktops,\nmobile apps, and other online platforms. Further, to reduce screen clutter, the Department is\nallowing summaries of baggage, change, and cancellation policies to be disclosed any time\nbefore ticket purchase, rather than requiring them to be disclosed contemporaneously with the\nfees as proposed.\n(d) In-Person and Telephone Disclosure of Fees\nProposal: The Department proposed disclosure of critical ancillary service fees for\ntickets purchased by telephone or in-person like those proposed for online purchases. Under the\nproposal, ticket agents and airlines would be required to disclose to consumers shopping in-\nperson or by phone the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on bags, ticket changes\nand cancellations, and family seating that apply to an itinerary for which a fare is quoted to the\nconsumer. The Department proposed to require ticket agents and carriers to provide this ancillary\nfee information for offline transactions when schedule information is provided during the\n“information” and “decision making” portion of the transaction. The Department explained its\nproposal would not allow ticket agents and carriers to wait to provide this information until after\nthe consumer has decided to make a reservation or purchase a ticket. The Department solicited\ncomment on alternative options for providing fee information on the phone or in person (e.g.,\nexplaining that fees may apply and referring the consumer to the carrier or ticket agent’s website,\nprovided that the website is accessible to consumers with disabilities).\nComments: The ACPAC recommended that the Department retain its proposal to require\ndisclosure of fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag when a fare\nis quoted to a consumer during an in-person or telephone inquiry. The ACPAC did not adopt as a\nrecommendation a suggestion from ticket agents that DOT modify its proposal to require bag\nfees and ticket change and cancellation fees to be provided “upon request” for offline\ntransactions. At the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, the member representing consumers\nexpressed concern that the suggestion by ticket agents to provide baggage fees only upon request\ncould lead to consumers having an incorrect understanding of the cost of the itinerary selected,\nand the member representing airport operators noted that the ticket agent suggestion regarding\nbaggage fees appeared to conflict with the proposed requirement that ticket agents must refund\nbaggage fees not disclosed during the ticket purchase process. Regarding change and\ncancellation fees, the ACPAC member representing consumers stated that consumers in offline\ntransactions should not have less information than those who transact online, and the member\nrepresenting state and local governments noted that seniors and low-income individuals may not\nhave access to or knowledge of online booking tools and stated that those individuals were no\nless deserving of or interested in fee information than those searching online.\nSimilarly, AARP supported DOT’s proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to\nprovide critical ancillary fee information at the time that schedule information is provided to the\nconsumer for offline transactions. AARP stated that “due to disability, lack of access, or simply\npreference, some consumers will seek fare information by phone or in person” and noted that\nthese same factors “would likely inhibit [those consumers] from looking for the fee disclosures\nonline.” An individual commenter similarly requested that the Department require disclosure of\ncritical ancillary fee information during phone bookings, stating that disclosure is necessary for\naccessibility and equal access to information for consumers using offline booking channels. This\ncommenter stated that the alternative of referring offline consumers to a website for ancillary fee\ninformation improperly places the burden on consumers to obtain fees when the burden should\nrest with sellers of air transportation.\nIndustry commenters generally opposed the proposal to require affirmative disclosure of\nfirst checked, second checked, and carry-on bag fees, change and cancellation fees, and family\nseating fees at the time that fare and schedule information is provided during offline transactions.\nThese commenters expressed concerns about the effect that the proposed offline disclosures\nwould have on the ability to maintain reasonable wait times and assist passengers in a timely\nmanner, with IATA noting that such concerns would be particularly acute when serving travelers\nat the ticket counter. Airlines further stated that the requirement to provide potentially dozens of\ncritical ancillary fees would confuse and overwhelm passengers, and Air Canada asserted that it\nis likely that consumers preferring phone or in-person services are not looking to compare prices.\nASTA estimated that the proposed disclosures would add at least 20 seconds to each offline\ntransaction by ticket agents at an estimated cost of $21.3 million per year in “talk time” for\nagents.\nIndustry commenters recommended alternatives to the Department’s proposal for offline\ndisclosures. Ticket agents and their associations generally suggested that DOT should require\nairlines and ticket agents to provide ancillary fee disclosures “upon request,” rather than\naffirmatively. For example, ASTA stated that requiring ancillary fee disclosures for offline\ntransactions only upon request “would allow ticket agents to use their professional judgement as\nto the fee-related information their clients need when such information is not specifically\nrequested,” with different levels of information appropriate for seasoned and infrequent travelers.\nTMC suggested that the Department allow airlines and ticket agents to direct consumers to an\nonline source for fee information, such as “an airline’s website, a corporate travel booking tool,\nor other available reference.” Similarly, some airlines and their associations asked the\nDepartment to allow carriers to advise passengers that additional fees may apply and direct\npassengers to an airline website for detailed ancillary fee disclosures. IATA asked that DOT\nallow disclosure that additional fees may apply “either to begin the call or during the time the\ncustomer is holding for an agent.” GBTA recommended that the Department consider requiring\ndisclosure of a “total likely price” after the agent obtains information on whether the consumer\nplans to check a bag.\nDOT Response: After carefully considering the comments, the Department is modifying its\nproposal for offline transactions in this final rule to require airlines and ticket agents to disclose\ncritical ancillary fees to consumers who request them following disclosure that such fees apply to\nthe searched itinerary. Specifically, the airline or ticket agent must disclose in an offline\ntransaction that baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees apply when a fare is quoted with\nan itinerary if that is the case, and ask the consumer if they wish to hear the specific baggage\nfees, change or cancellation fees, and any other critical ancillary service fees that apply. If the\nconsumer requests information about a single or multiple critical ancillary fees, then the airline\nor ticket agent must disclose the requested information that applies to the fare and itinerary\nquoted, adjusted based on any passenger-specific information provided by the consumer.\nThe Department agrees with comments stating that requiring disclosure of critical\nancillary fee information for all possible flight options to all offline consumers at the time that\nschedule information is provided might significantly increase hold times and delay airlines and\nticket agents in assisting consumers. Therefore, the Department is permitting such offline\ndisclosures to be made upon the consumer’s request, provided that affirmative notice is given\nthat a fee applies to the quoted itinerary. The Department disagrees with comments asking that it\nauthorize airlines and ticket agents to refer passengers who seek booking assistance offline to\ncritical ancillary fee information in online sources or that it should allow ticket sellers to provide\nthis information only upon request without any affirmative disclosure required. While carrier\nwebsites must be accessible for passengers with disabilities,100 the Department agrees with\n100 14 CFR 382.43(c).\nAARP that the same factors that lead some consumers to seek offline information about\nschedules and fares may also inhibit those consumers seeking critical ancillary fee information\nonline, and so the recommendation to refer consumers to online sources would not appropriately\naddress the needs of passengers. In addition, because fees for change and cancellation are often\nprovided as a range on airline websites, finding the specific applicable change or cancellation fee\nfor an itinerary quoted offline would be impracticable.\nThe Department’s requirement that sellers of air transportation inform consumers in\noffline transactions that bag fees and change and cancellation fees apply to a particular itinerary\nis intended to provide consumers notice that a specific itinerary being quoted to them carries\nadditional fees for these ancillary services. It is not sufficient to provide a generic disclosure that\n“additional fees may apply,” as recommended by IATA. Such a statement provides little useful\ninformation to consumers searching for the total cost of an itinerary and does not indicate what\nfees apply or the amount of those fees. The Department found that a similar notice in online\nsearch tools, as required by existing regulation, was equally insufficient. As provided in this final\nrule, the requirement is to provide a statement that bag fees, change fees, and cancellation fees\napply to a specific itinerary being quoted, if that is the case. If, for the quoted itinerary, there is\nno additional charge for the consumer to check one or two bags or to bring on-board a carry-on\nbag, or to change or cancel the ticket, then no statement about these fees need be made in\nassociation with the quoted itinerary. If, however, a fee for one or more critical ancillary services\napplies to the quoted itinerary, then, under the requirement in this rule, the airline or ticket agent\nmust notify the consumer that an additional fee applies for baggage or change or cancellation and\npermit the consumer to request the fee information. If the consumer requests fee information for\nany critical ancillary service, the airline or ticket agent must disclose it.\nThe requirement in this rule strikes the appropriate balance between minimizing delays in\nassisting passengers at the ticket counter or by phone and ensuring that consumers receive\ncritical ancillary fee information. The Department does not adopt GBTA’s proposal to permit\nairlines and ticket agents to quote a “total likely price” based on whether a consumer plans to\ncheck a bag because that proposal does not address all critical ancillary fee information nor\nwould the allowance for a “likely” price quote allow a passenger to assess the true cost of air\ntravel.\n(5) Passenger-Specific and Anonymous Search Fee Disclosures\nProposal: The Department proposed to require passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary\nsearch disclosure of critical ancillary service fees, based on the consumer’s choice, whenever\nfare and schedule information is provided. For searches where the passenger elects to provide\npassenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent, such as frequent flyer status,\npayment method, or military status, the Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents\ndisplay the fees for critical ancillary services in the form of passenger-specific charges for the\nitinerary. The Department proposed to treat a search as passenger-specific if a user provided\npassenger-specific information to the airline or ticket agent before conducting the search\n“including when conducting previous searches if the information is cached, or if the user\nconducts a search while logged into the search website and the operating entity of that website\nhas passenger-specific information as part of the user’s profile.”101 If the consumer conducting a\nsearch elects not to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent (i.e., the\nconsumer conducts an “anonymous itinerary search”), then the Department proposed to require\ncarriers and ticket agents to display the fees for critical ancillary services as itinerary-specific\ncharges.\nComments: The ACPAC recommended that the Department maintain its proposal to\nrequire airlines and ticket agents to display passenger-specific baggage and change and\ncancellation fees in any final rule. At the January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC member\nrepresenting airlines stated that providing passenger-specific fees increases the complexity of the\nsearch process. He urged ACPAC members to consider the amount of information required to be\n101 87 FR 63736.\npresented to consumers under the NPRM and the impact these disclosures could have on the speed\nof providing search results to consumers given the number of ancillary fees required to be\ndisplayed at the time schedule and fare information is first provided.\nIn their written comments and hearing testimony, other industry commenters also\nopposed the requirement to provide passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services. These\ncommenters stated that passengers who have status with an airline already know about the\nbenefits associated with their status, and so the disclosure would have little benefit for those\nconsumers. The commenters added that it was impractical for consumers to provide ticket agents\nwith all possible loyalty numbers before conducting a search. They further added that it was\ntechnologically infeasible to comply with the passenger-specific requirement, particularly on the\nfirst page of search results, with many citing concerns about technology for ticket agents to\nvalidate the passenger’s status before displaying passenger-specific fees. For example, Booking\nHoldings stated that “to enable passenger-specific displays that would need validation from\nairlines (e.g., frequent flyer account status and credit card affinity status) or third parties (e.g.,\nmilitary status), would be technically prohibitive.” Booking Holdings added that, without\nvalidation of information provided by the consumer, there is a risk that online travel agents\nwould provide incorrect information to consumers about applicable fees.\nSimilarly, American Airlines testified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public\nhearing about challenges with validating passenger status using the EDIFACT platform and\nstated that querying and displaying passenger-specific fees at the first page of search results\nwould affect the reliability and speed of search results. American Airlines further acknowledged\nin its comments, however, that it currently provides passenger-specific information “to the extent\ntechnologically feasible,” including seat and bag fees for passengers with status logged in to the\nairline’s website and military personnel who access the American Airlines site through a military\nbooking channel. Echoing concerns raised by other commenters, American Airlines stated that\nother passenger-specific fee information is impracticable to provide at the first page of search\nresults because it cannot be validated at that time, citing the example of military status for\nindividuals booking travel outside of an official military booking channel. In addition, Google\nexpressed concern about consumer privacy if metasearch entities were required to collect and\nshare customer data with airlines and ticket agents to comply with the passenger-specific search\nrequirement.\nTicket agents uniformly expressed concerns about the volume of queries they would need\nto conduct to provide passenger-specific information. For example, USTOA commented that\n“the volume of data transmission necessary to provide for the level of specificity [for passenger-\nspecific fees] contemplated under the proposed rule is unmanageably large and complex,” noting\nthat there are currently 47 different co-branded credit cards for “major” U.S. airlines, with\nvarious policies across airlines regarding when the airline waives the passenger’s bag fee (e.g.,\nsome credit cards entitle a passenger’s travel companion to a free bag, while others do not).\nSimilarly, Sabre commented that the proposed rule required passenger-specific information for\ntoo many passenger characteristics and added that it was unclear that the list of passenger-\nspecific criteria in the NPRM was exhaustive. In addition, Sabre expressed concern that the\nrequirement to provide passenger-specific ancillary fee information could lead to providing\ninapplicable fee information if only one passenger in a travel party has status or if status is lost\nbetween the time of booking and travel. Further, Travel Tech stated that “ticket agents would\nneed to receive a huge volume of data from airlines for this proposal to work, but systems to\nexchange vast amounts of passenger-specific status information between airlines, agents and\nGDSs do not currently exist.” Given the concerns raised by ticket agents, Booking Holdings\nrequested that DOT not require passenger-specific disclosures, at least until new systems could\nbe developed, and asked the Department to modify the proposal to require airlines and ticket\nagents to inform passengers how fees may differ based on frequent flyer privileges, military\nstatus, and other factors, instead of providing specific fees.\nA joint comment from multiple consumer groups stated that the options for anonymous\nand passenger-specific searches “will be beneficial to consumers, allowing them to customize\ntheir purchasing process.” This comment further stated that any additional time necessary to\nimplement passenger-specific requirements should not be used to delay the implementation\ntimeline for the rest of the NPRM’s requirements. Travelers United stated that passenger-specific\ncharacteristics can make a significant difference in determining the total price of an airfare but\nnoted that the complexity of ancillary fee structures makes providing that information on a single\npage “difficult, if not impossible with current technology.”\nDOT Response: This final rule maintains, with modifications, the requirement for airlines\nand ticket agents to provide passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services if the consumer\nelects to provide passenger-specific information, and to provide itinerary-specific fees for critical\nancillary services if the consumer does not do so. The Department clarifies that the list of\ninformation specific to the passenger provided in the rule text—frequent flyer status, military\nstatus, and credit card status—is illustrative and not exhaustive. Because variation in fees within\neach carrier depends on the status of the passenger, fares provided without additional disclosure\nof the critical ancillary fees specific to the passenger fail to provide consumers with adequate\nnotice of the total cost of the air transportation. Disclosure of the passenger-specific fees will\npromote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices.\nThe Department disagrees with comments stating that the complexity of airline policies\nfor assessing passenger-specific fees or the number of queries that must be conducted to produce\npassenger-specific fees counsels against adopting a passenger-specific fee requirement. Ancillary\nfee structures that ticket agents or airlines find complex to administer are likely to lead to\nconsumer confusion regarding fees. The costly and time-consuming burdens of determining\npassenger-specific fees are currently borne by consumers, a key harm that the Department seeks\nto remedy in this final rule, and makes disclosure of such fees necessary, even for experienced\ntravelers with airline status. In addition, this final rule allows additional flexibility for industry\nbeyond what was proposed, which will reduce the burdens to airlines and ticket agents in\ndisclosing passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services.\nFurther, many of the commenters who opposed the requirement to provide passenger-\nspecific fees appear to believe that the proposal would require airlines and ticket agents to\nvalidate the passenger-specific information provided by the consumer before displaying itinerary\nsearch results. Those comments misunderstood the Department’s proposal. Neither the NPRM\nnor this final rule would require an airline or ticket agent to verify passenger-provided\ninformation before disclosing critical ancillary fees when schedule and fare information is\nprovided. To address this misunderstanding, in this final rule, the Department clarifies that the\ndisclosure of critical ancillary fees to consumers may be based on information provided by\nconsumers. If a consumer elects to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket\nagent, that consumer has a responsibility for ensuring the information provided is accurate. An\nairline or ticket agent that relies on the information provided by a consumer when disclosing the\ncritical ancillary service fees applicable to that consumer would not be in violation of the\nrequirement for the fee information to be accurate should the consumer provide inaccurate\ninformation (e.g., incorrect frequent flyer account status or credit card affinity status). An airline\nor ticket agent may elect to verify passenger-provided information at the point that the critical\nancillary service is purchased rather than at the time of itinerary search. While this may result in\nthe passenger later being charged a different fee than what was disclosed during the initial search\n(e.g., if the passenger entered erroneous passenger-specific information), such harm is\nreasonably avoidable by the consumer providing the airline or ticket agent with accurate\npassenger-specific information.\nThe Department concludes that it is feasible for airlines and ticket agents to provide\npassenger-specific information as required by this final rule. American Airlines’ comment\nsuggests that it already provides much of the passenger-specific ancillary fee information\nrequired by the rule, providing strong evidence that the proposal can be implemented. In\naddition, many consumers, including those with a beneficial status, may choose to conduct an\nanonymous itinerary search, limiting the potential burden on carriers and ticket agents to conduct\npassenger-specific adjustments in the aggregate. The barrier that American Airlines identified to\npassenger-specific fees (i.e., the need for validation of passenger data before the display of fees)\nis not required for compliance, and the Department expects this fact to further mitigate the\nconcerns of regulated entities regarding potential burdens. In addition, the Department has made\nseveral changes and clarifications from the NPRM that address concerns commenters raised\nabout the feasibility of the proposed passenger-specific fee requirement. First, the Department\nhas extended the period for compliance with the final rule’s requirements, as discussed in section\nF, to allow additional time for data sharing and implementation of the final rule’s requirements.\nIn addition, this final rule does not require airlines and ticket agents to disclose or transact family\nseating fees, a key area of technical concern for many industry commenters. Further, this final\nrule provides flexibility in how fee information is displayed so long as the information is\naccurate, clear, and conspicuous, rather than limiting these disclosures to a display in static text\nas proposed. The Department expects that these changes will greatly reduce the technological\nburdens of disclosing passenger-specific fee information when schedule and fare information is\nprovided in response to a consumer’s search.\nBecause this final rule does not require ticket agents to validate passenger-specific data,\nthe privacy concerns raised by Google do not apply. The Department nonetheless concludes that\nprivacy concerns could be implicated if an airline or ticket agent treats an itinerary search as\n“passenger-specific” based on information not affirmatively provided by the passenger for that\nsearch, such as a search based on cached information. Under this rule, a consumer is entitled the\noption to conduct an anonymous itinerary search, which does not consider any passenger-\nspecific information. A consumer should not see a specific fee or ticket price tailored to the\nconsumer if the consumer elects to conduct an anonymous itinerary search. If such a search did,\nin fact, take into account passenger-specific information not affirmatively provided by the\npassenger for that search, the Department may take the view that the consumer was not afforded\nan anonymous itinerary search, which would be a violation of this regulation. Accordingly, this\nfinal rule defines a search as passenger-specific only when the search is based on information\naffirmatively provided by the passenger to the airline or ticket agent for purposes of that search.\n(6) Opt-Out Provisions\nProposal: The Department did not propose to permit airlines and ticket agents to enable\nconsumers to opt out of receiving fee information for any critical ancillary services during the\nsearch process. Instead, the Department sought comment on whether to allow carriers and ticket\nagents to provide consumers an opt-out option from receiving ancillary service fee information\nthat would otherwise be required. The Department explained that opt-out options could\npotentially include the choice to opt out of seeing all baggage fee information that would\notherwise be required to be displayed (first and second checked bag and carry-on bag), to opt out\nof seeing fee information related to changing or canceling a reservation, to opt out of seeing seat\nfee information for a child traveling with an adult, or to opt out of seeing some of those fees.\nComments: Industry commenters generally supported permitting consumers to opt out of\ncritical ancillary fee disclosures. These commenters stated that experienced travelers aware of\nairline ancillary fees may want to opt out of disclosures and that allowing consumers to opt out\nwould provide a more efficient search with customized results for consumers. Spirit Airlines\ncommented that a binary choice of whether a consumer wishes to view ancillary fee information\nprovided at the start of the search process avoids any concern about “click wrap” tactics that do\nnot represent a meaningful choice for consumers. Among industry commenters who recommended\nvariations on this general approach, Booking Holdings recommended that consumers be required\nto affirmatively opt in to receive critical ancillary fee disclosures, stating that its recommendation\nwas based on studies that demonstrate that schedule and fare are the most important factors in a\nconsumer’s decision. Google supported either an opt-out or opt-in provision for metasearch sites.\nGroups representing consumers and individual commenters recommended different\napproaches. AARP recommended allowing opt outs in limited circumstances, stating, for\nexample, it may be acceptable to allow “a traveler to opt out of certain disclosures (such as a\nsingle traveler opting out of adjacent seating fee disclosures)” on a mobile app where screen\nspace is limited, but it added that any circumstance in which opt outs are permitted “should be\nthe exception rather than the rule.” One individual supported allowing consumers to opt out of\nancillary fee disclosures based on concern about information overload from disclosure of all\ncritical ancillary fees at the first page of search results. Another opposed opt outs with the view\nthat opt outs improperly empower airlines and ticket agents to frame the question to the user\nabout whether to forgo the otherwise-required information. That individual instead\nrecommended that fees be “zeroed out” when both the airline and consumer have reason to\nbelieve based on information from the initial fare search or customer profile that the consumer\ndoes not need a particular ancillary service.\nFor first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage, the ACPAC recommended that\nconsumers should be given the opportunity to indicate how many bags they will be traveling with\nearly in the itinerary search process, and the fees applicable to the consumers’ selections should\nthen be displayed. This recommendation was proposed by the ACPAC Chair who stated that she\ndid not believe that her recommendation was an opt-in or an opt-out. The ACPAC member\nrepresenting airlines viewed this proposal as an opt in by consumers and stated that the\nrecommendation was contrary to the Department’s proposal. This member expressed concern\nabout how regulating the search landing page could impact efficient search options currently\navailable to consumers.\nAt the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing, NCL supported the same approach\nrecommended by the ACPAC, and FlyersRights made a similar recommendation in its written\ncomments. Travel Tech objected to the ACPAC recommendation on the basis that, in its view, the\nrecommendation was outside the scope of the NPRM. Travel Tech further commented that the\nACPAC recommendation would require ticket agents to redesign their websites to include a bag\ninquiry, which would require significant resources. Travel Tech asked that ticket agents be\nprovided with flexibility to adopt this method at their option.\nRegarding change and cancellation fees, the ACPAC recommended that the Department\nshould not provide the option for consumers to opt out of receiving change and cancellation fee\ninformation. The ACPAC member representing airport operators stated that because change and\ncancellation fees are not an a la carte item that consumers select but instead operate as penalties,\nthe Department should require their display with no opt-out allowance.\nDOT Response: The Department agrees with AARP that enabling opt outs from\ndisclosure of ancillary fees that DOT has determined are critical to consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions “should be the exception rather than the rule.” Accordingly, this final rule requires\nairlines and ticket agents to disclose change and cancellation fees to all consumers before ticket\npurchase without any opt-out allowance. It also prohibits airlines and ticket agents from enabling\nconsumers to opt out of receiving fee information for a first checked bag, a second checked bag,\nor a carry-on bag during the search process with one exception. In response to the\nrecommendation by the ACPAC, the Department is allowing an exception to the requirement to\ndisclose fees for transporting a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag on\nonline platforms in circumstances where a consumer affirmatively indicates that no one in their\nbooking party plans to travel with a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag.\nMore specifically, under the final rule, a carrier or ticket agent is excepted from the\nrequirement to disclose bag fees with the fare and schedule information if (1) an airline or ticket\nagent asks its consumers if they intend to travel with a carry-on bag or checked bags; and (2)\nconsumers affirmatively indicate that no one in the booking party intends to travel with a carry-\non bag or first or second checked bags. The Department notes that if consumers affirm that they\nare not traveling with any bags, then the carrier or ticket agent does not have to disclose any of\nthe bag fees. If consumers affirm that they are not traveling with a checked bag, then the carrier\nor agent is not required to disclose the fees for first or second checking bags. If consumers fail to\nprovide an affirmation, then the carrier and ticket agent must display all the required bag fees.\nThe Department is making this exception available to carriers and ticket agents should they\nprefer it to providing fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag in all\ninstances when fare and schedule information is provided. A carrier or ticket agent that elects to\nuse this exception must still provide the baggage weight and dimension information discussed in\nsection E (4)(b) before ticket purchase so that a consumer has access to information about\nwhether their travel plans are consistent with a particular carrier’s weight and dimension\nlimitations.\nIn contrast to baggage fees, consumers are unlikely to know at the time of booking that\nthey would later need to cancel or change a flight and are unable to opt-out of these fees on an\ninformed basis. As explained in the NPRM, change and cancellation fees can be significant and,\nin some cases, higher than the original fare paid by the consumer. Accordingly, this final rule\ndoes not allow airlines and ticket agents to enable consumers to opt out of disclosure of change\nand cancellation fees.\n(7) Transactability\nProposal: The Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents that impose a\nfee for children 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult to enable the purchase of\nfamily seating at the point of ticket purchase (i.e., transactability). The Department explained\nthat transactability is necessary because consumers are not able to save the seat or lock in the\nprice for adjacent seating at the time of ticket purchase. The Department did not prescribe a\nparticular way for the regulated entities to comply. It noted that, to ensure that a consumer\nreceives family seating information as part of the itinerary search results and accompanying fare\nquotations, a carrier or ticket agent could decide to enable consumers to disclose that a passenger\n13 or under will be traveling prior to initiating an itinerary search. The Department also stated\nthat a carrier or ticket agent could alternatively decide to display seating fees for all itinerary\nsearches, regardless of whether a consumer disclosed that a passenger was 13 or under.\nIn contrast, the Department did not propose to require fees for a first checked, second\nchecked, or carry-on bag or a ticket change or cancellation to be transactable at the point of\npurchase. The Department explained that it has not identified evidence of consumer harm\nresulting from a lack of transactability of baggage, change, or cancellation fees because these\nfees cannot increase after ticket purchase. In addition, the Department observed that there is no\nchange or cancellation fee to transact at the point of ticket purchase because the consumer would\nnot know at that time that they will cancel or change the ticket.\nComments: Ticket agents, including GDSs, and their associations generally requested that\nthe Department require transactability of all critical ancillary fees, not only fees for children 13\nor younger to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult. Representatives of the travel\ntechnology industry also made this recommendation at the June 2022 ACPAC meeting.102\nAmong the concerns expressed by Amadeus, Travelport, Travel Tech, and others were that the\ninability to purchase ancillary services from ticket agents would drive consumers away from\nticket agents, harm the ability of consumers to comparison shop, and result in consumers\nspending additional time to purchase ancillary services on airline websites after purchasing fares\nfrom ticket agents. These commenters stated that consumers might pay more to purchase\nancillary services at a later time if the Department elects not to require transactability of all\ncritical ancillary fees. For example, Travel Tech stated that, if airlines are able to quote different\nbaggage fee amounts depending on when the passenger pays for the bag (e.g., a higher fee\napplies if paid closer to the flight date or at the airport instead of at the time of booking), then the\nlack of transactability for a first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag could still result in a\npassenger paying more than they would at the point of ticket purchase.\n102 See presentations of ASTA, Travel Tech, and Amadeus, and Skyscanner, available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (June 2022, Day 1 afternoon\nsession).\nSome ticket agents, including GDSs, and associations also asked the Department to\nexpand the proposed requirement for transactable family seating fees to include all seat fees. For\nexample, Booking Holdings asked DOT to require transactability of all seat fees if DOT\nmaintained the proposed requirement that family seating fees be transactable because the\n“significant expense of building the required technology would be offset by greater functionality\nfor most consumers” if the proposal were expanded. Amadeus asserted that there was a\nparticularly strong argument for transactability of all seat fees due to availability and price\nchanges. However, the U.S. Tour Operators Association (USTOA) and others stated that ticket\nagents currently lack the technology to make seat fees transactable.\nAirlines and metasearch providers urged the Department not to require transactability of\nany critical ancillary service fee including family seating fees. For example, IATA and\nSouthwest submitted comments opposing transactability requirements for any ancillary fees.\nThese commenters expressed concern that airlines and ticket agents operate through contractual\narrangements and stated that airlines should not be required to contract with third parties to sell\nairlines services. IATA testified at the Department’s March 30, 2023, public hearing that travel\nagent websites would require new digital connections to airlines to display transactable seat fees,\nwhich would require years of information technology development. Metasearch providers\nSkyscanner and Google expressed concern that the proposed rule’s transactability requirement\nwould alter the nature of their business by requiring metasearch sites to sell seating.\nDOT Response: The Department has decided not to impose any requirement in this final\nrule that ancillary fees be transactable at the point of ticket purchase. As discussed in section E\n(3)(c), the Department is not moving forward with its proposal to require carriers and ticket\nagents disclose fees for young children to be seated next to an accompanying adult on an aircraft\nand is instead pursuing a separate rulemaking to prohibit these fees.103 Additionally, as discussed\n103 See Fall 2023 Unified Agenda for rulemaking titled “Family Seating in Air Transportation” (RIN 2105-AF15) at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AF15.\nin section E (3)(d), given that the cost of air transportation includes a seat and the lack of clarity\nabout the importance of seat selection fees to consumers, the Department is not requiring carriers\nor ticket agents to disclose seating fees as required critical ancillary service fees in this final rule.\nFurther, the Department continues to be of the view that the lack of transactability of baggage,\nchange, or cancellation fees does not harm consumers.\nThe Department is not persuaded by comments asserting that consumers might pay more\nto purchase ancillary services if the Department elects not to require transactability of all critical\nancillary service fees. The Department has identified transporting a first checked, second\nchecked, and/or carry-on bag and changing or canceling a reservation as critical ancillary\nservices. The fee rules for these critical ancillary services do not change after a consumer has\npurchased a ticket. The fees that are disclosed to the consumer during the booking process will\nbe those fees that apply to the ticket. Because the fee schedules for critical ancillary services are\neffectively frozen at the time of ticket purchase—which may include disclosing that fees will be\nhigher if paid at the airport rather than at time of booking so long as that is disclosed up front—\nrequiring transactability of critical ancillary service fees at the point of ticket purchase would\nprovide little value, as consumers would be able to pay for critical ancillary services in the time\nand manner of their choosing. Through the fee disclosures required by this rule, consumers\nshould be aware, for example, that a bag fee may be higher on the day of travel, if that is the\ncase, so they can plan accordingly.\nAlso, as noted in the NPRM, because consumers would not know that they will cancel or\nchange a flight at the time of ticket purchase, there is nothing to transact for those fees at the time\nof purchase. As with baggage fees, increases beyond the fees that were disclosed at the time of\nticket purchase are prohibited for change or cancellation fees, and so there is no consumer harm\nfrom not requiring change or cancellation fees to be transactable at the point of ticket purchase.\nThe Department disagrees with commenters that the lack of a requirement to make\ncritical ancillary fees transactable on ticket agent websites will drive consumers away from ticket\nagents. This rule maintains the status quo on the transactability of ancillary fees. A significant\npercentage of airline ticket sales are handled by ticket agents today, even in the absence of a\nregulatory requirement that ancillary fees be transactable on ticket agent websites, and ticket\nagents will continue to have the option under this final rule to enter into contractual agreements\nwith carriers to sell ancillary services.\n(8) Data Sharing\nProposal: The Department proposed to require airlines that provide fare, schedule, and\navailability information to ticket agents to sell or display the carrier’s flights directly to\nconsumers, to provide such ticket agents useable, current, and accurate information of the fee\nrules for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, one carry-on bag, canceling a reservation,\nand changing a reservation. The Department also proposed that such airlines provide family\nseating fee rules to ticket agents and enable these fees to be transactable by ticket agents. The\nintention of the proposal was for ticket agents to have access to critical ancillary service fee\ninformation sufficient to enable the ticket agents to disclose such fees to consumers.\nUnder the proposal, carriers would not be required to distribute ancillary service fee\ninformation to any ticket agent to whom the carrier does not choose to distribute its fare,\nschedule, and availability information. If a carrier did not share fare information with a ticket\nagent, then this proposal would not require that carrier to share ancillary service fee information\nwith that ticket agent. The proposal left open the method by which carriers could choose to\ndistribute fee information to ticket agents. The Department did not propose to require carriers use\nGDSs to distribute fee information to ticket agents. Each carrier would determine for itself\nwhether to distribute critical ancillary service fee information through GDSs as most carriers\nalready use GDSs to distribute fare and schedule information.104\n104 The Department has also discussed the airline distribution system in prior rulemakings. See, e.g., 79 FR 29970,\n29975 (May 23, 2014), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2014-05-23/pdf/2014-11993.pdf and\n82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-00904.pdf.\nComments: Industry comments on this issue were extensive. While airlines generally\nagreed that the rule should not require that they use GDSs to distribute fee information to ticket\nagents that sell or display directly to consumers, some airlines also expressed concern regarding\nthe proposed requirement to distribute information. Ticket agents, on the other hand, expressed\nthe view that airlines should be required to distribute information to any entity to which the\nairlines distribute fare and schedule information, including GDSs.\nThe ACPAC deliberated on the subject of data sharing, and although it did not make a\nrecommendation on whether or how the data should be shared, the ACPAC member representing\nconsumers commented that he did not see how ticket agents could display fees if the fee\ninformation was not provided to them.105 The ACPAC members representing airlines and\nairports supported the Department’s proposal on not requiring airlines to share fee information\nwith GDSs, with the member representing airlines expressing agreement with the Department’s\nrationale to not interfere with contractual relationships.106 During deliberations, the member\nrepresenting airlines commented that airline contractual relationships are the result of bargained-\nfor terms, and he cautioned the committee from weighing into those relationships and giving one\nparty veto power over the other in negotiations. The member representing airports noted that the\nsharing of data is the foundation for all other disclosure recommendations regarding ticket\nagents. The ACPAC’s recommendation on data sharing was for the Department to clarify and\nrefine what is meant by “useable, current, and accessible in real-time” and “non-static dynamic\nfashion” when describing how data is to be shared by airlines to ticket agents.\nIn written comments, IATA, A4A, the National Airlines Council of Canada, and several\nother airlines supported the proposal’s lack of a mandate on providing fee information to GDSs.\nIATA also commented that airlines should not be required to share data with metasearch\n105 See Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee - January 12, 2023, Meeting Minutes, available at\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0111.\n106 No recommendations were made on this specific question, as two of the four ACPAC members were prepared to\nabstain from voting on this issue.\ncompanies that are not authorized agents of the airline. IATA noted two available options for\nestablishing agent-airline connections sufficient to present dynamic bag fee information: direct\nconnect, where the agent or agency enters into a direct connection with an airline, or IATA’s\nNew Distribution Capability (NDC), essentially an XML-based technical standard for use in\nairline distribution where an airline shares its NDC application programming interface with the\nticket agent or the agent’s technology provider. On NDC, American Airlines added that NDC\nprovides more information and better customization than GDSs. IATA stated that some online\nticket agents contract directly with ATPCO for fee information rather than relying on GDSs.\nIATA expressed concern about the capabilities of GDSs, stating that GDSs would need to divert\nIT resources away from improving the passenger booking experience to instead deliver ancillary\nfee information. It noted that GDSs had trouble implementing the requirements of the 2011 final\nrule, due to its outdated system EDIFACT, and that GDSs have not met their commitments to\nsupport the NDC. IATA also stated that a requirement to use GDSs would give the three major\nGDS companies the ability to extract exorbitant fees from airlines and artificially extend the use\nof an outdated network. A4A added its view that GDSs generally resist carrier innovation in\nproduct offerings, and American Airlines agreed that GDSs lack technological capabilities.\nSome individual airlines and an individual commenter opposed any requirement to\ndistribute ancillary fee information to ticket agents. Air Canada stated that the rule would force\ncarriers to manage GDSs and how their information would be displayed on other channels, and\nthe individual commenter asserted that airlines would be put in the position of being called to\ntask for problems caused and errors made by third parties. Frontier Airlines stated that it uses\nproprietary technology and algorithms incompatible with GDSs, and any requirement that it\nprovide data to ticket agents would require rebuilding the airline’s distribution capabilities.\nSouthwest Airlines stated that it does not generally contract with ticket agents and that the\ndecision on whether to contract with a ticket agent should be left to the airline. The individual\ncommenter also stated that the proposal was contrary to the Airline Deregulation Act by forcing\nairlines to conduct business with OTAs and GDSs, even though the carrier’s own business plan\nand IT system may be designed only for direct sales to the customer.\nTicket agents, including GDSs, generally asserted that the rule should require airlines to\ndistribute fee information to GDSs. Travel Tech, for example, stated that the rule should include\nGDSs as ticket agents, and it added that it would support requiring fee information to be\nprovided to all intermediaries to which an airline provides fares for distribution, including\nATPCO and GDSs. Travel Tech noted that airlines already provide fare data to GDSs, and it\ndisagreed with airlines’ expressed concern that GDSs were wedded to old technology and will\nabuse market power. According to Travel Tech, the requirement to display passenger-specific\nbaggage fees is infeasible for ticket agents, and not requiring the use of GDSs will add to\ndevelopment time and costs. Travel Tech and others noted that significant resources would be\nrequired for travel agencies to negotiate separately with each airline, with Travelport noting that\nthis may cause agencies to shut down. Travel Tech added that GDSs are the only entities capable\nof distributing ancillary fee data in the short-term. The organization asserted that NDC is not an\nadequate replacement for GDSs. Amadeus expressed disagreement with IATA’s assertion that its\ntechnology was outdated or that GDSs would need to divert resources away from making\ntechnological improvements to meet the requirements in the rule. Amadeus added that requiring\nthat airlines share data with GDSs would not delay implementation of the NDC, and that the\nNDC and EDIFACT would need to coexist for some time, with NDC still in its infancy. Other\nticket agent associations and individual ticket agents, such as ASTA and Hopper, as well as\nGDSs, agreed with the viewpoint that airlines should be required to distribute fee information to\nGDSs.\nMetasearch entities supported the objective of having access to airline fee information,\nbut they noted several concerns. Skyscanner stated that it supported the sharing of ancillary fee\ninformation with metasearch entities, noting that the requirement would address a longstanding\nlack of fee disclosure by airlines and ensure that metasearch sites can display fee information.\nSkyscanner also stated that it depends on direct connect arrangements and ATPCO and GDSs as\nthe primary source of its data, and that the information sharing requirements should be extended\nto include those latter entities. Google agreed that fee information should be provided to all\nintermediaries and distribution channels that may be relied upon by consumer-facing entities.\nSkyscanner also urged the Department not to permit airlines to impose restrictions on the way\ntheir fee information is used by the recipients of the information.\nSeveral commenters expressed viewpoints on the terms “useable, current, and accessible\nin real-time” and “non-static, dynamic fashion,” as referenced in the NPRM. Travel Tech\nexpressed agreement with the ACPAC recommendation to clarify the meaning of these terms,\nand it believed that these changes should not require expensive or costly manipulation for the\ndisplay of fees. Travel Tech also expressed the view that airlines should be encouraged to work\ntoward data uniformity or standardization, with Travelport adding that airlines can more\nefficiently bear the cost of standardizing their own data rather than individual ticket agents.\nSabre stated that airlines should be made to distribute ancillary fee information in a standardized\nmachine-readable format across all channels they already use to distribute fares, including GDSs.\nUSTOA expressed concern that terms like “useable” would be susceptible to differing\ninterpretations, and it agreed that a lack of industry standards for furnishing information to ticket\nagents would impose increased compliance costs and practical burdens. Skyscanner stated that\nfee data is not “useable” if it requires costly processing or other manipulation before it can be\ndisplayed.\nMultiple commenters, including Travel Tech, Bookings Holdings, and Skyscanner,\nexpressed concern about being held responsible for inaccurate or incomplete fee data provided\nby airlines. Travel Tech noted, for example, that ticket agents should not be responsible for\nfailing to display information not provided by airlines and should not be barred from providing\nflight information because airlines have not provided accurate fee data. Skyscanner urged the\nDepartment to clarify that metasearch sites and other entities will not be held responsible if\nairlines fail to provide covered fee information, which would prevent these entities from\ndisplaying the information to consumers, and it also believes that it should be allowed to display\nfare, schedule, and availability information even if it has not received accompanying ancillary\nfee information from the airline.\nDOT Response: After carefully considering the comments on this issue, the Department\nis requiring airlines to share critical ancillary fee information with any entity that is required by\nlaw to disclose critical ancillary service fee and policy information directly to consumers.107 The\nDepartment agrees with commenters, including members of the ACPAC, regarding the need for\nairlines to share fee information with ticket agents for those ticket agents to make the required\nfee disclosures. In the Department’s view, the requirement for fee data sharing is necessary to\nenable ticket agents to disclose fees to consumers when providing fare and schedule information.\nThe Department provides its analysis of how the failure to share critical ancillary fee information\nis an unfair practice in section D (1)(d). In this final rule, as discussed in section E (1), the\nDepartment is requiring ticket agents to disclose critical ancillary service fees and policies to\nconsumers. The Department is excluding corporate travel agents from these requirements and\ndeferring to another rulemaking its determination on whether metasearch sites that do not sell\nairline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents that\nmust disclose ancillary fee information required. Accordingly, this final rule does not require\nairlines to share critical ancillary service fees with corporate travel agents. It also does not\nrequire sharing of information with metasearch entities unless and until metasearch entities are\nrequired to disclose that information to consumers. Despite the absence of a regulatory\nrequirement, the Department recognizes that it benefits consumers, metasearch sites, and airlines\nif all critical ancillary fee information is available through all sources that consumers use to shop\nfor air transportation. As a result, the Department encourages airlines and metasearch sites to\n107 As noted in sections E (3)(c) and E (7), the Department has decided not to move forward with its data sharing and\ntransactability proposals related to family seating fees at this time.\nenter into voluntary agreements to share critical ancillary fee information while further\nregulatory action is under consideration.\nThe Department continues to hold the view that it is not appropriate to require carriers to\nuse GDSs to distribute fee information to ticket agents. The Department’s interest is in ensuring\nthat ticket agents disclose critical ancillary service fees to consumers whenever fare and schedule\ninformation is provided. Whether carriers share the required data through GDSs or by direct\nconnect or by NDC are business decisions, and the Department seeks to minimize government\ninterference with the business relationships between airlines, GDSs, and others. The Department\nnotes that changes appear to be ongoing in the marketplace for information distribution,\nincluding the adoption and use of NDC. Further, the comments illustrate that there continue to be\ndisagreements between airlines and GDSs on whether GDSs have the modern technology airlines\nneed to merchandise and sell their products the way the airlines choose. The Department is\nunwilling to impose a prescriptive requirement on this issue while the situation is evolving and\nwhile the dynamic between airlines and GDSs remains highly complex. We believe that these\nairline-GDS relationships are best left to the marketplace. Nothing in this rule precludes or\nrequires airlines to use GDSs to distribute critical ancillary fee information to consumer-facing\nticket agents. As noted in the NPRM, GDSs may provide the lowest cost and most efficient way\nof distributing this information to ticket agents that sell the carrier’s ancillary services. This may\nlead airlines to conclude that they need or want to use GDSs to distribute fee information to meet\nthe implementation deadlines imposed by this rule. The Department notes that these\ncircumstances may change in the future and an overly prescriptive requirement may become too\nrigid and may ultimately hurt, rather than improve, the consumer experience.\nAlso, the Department is adopting its proposal requiring the sharing of critical ancillary\nfee information only with the entities that a carrier chooses to distribute its fare, schedule, and\navailability information. Under this final rule, airlines are required to share critical ancillary fee\ninformation only with those entities with whom they provide fare, schedule, and availability\ninformation and who are required to disclose this information directly to consumers. Airlines are\nnot required to share ancillary service fee information with entities with whom they have no\nexisting relationship for sharing airline schedule and fare information.\nOn the terms “current, useable, and accessible in real-time” (or “useable, current, and\naccurate,” as this phrase appears in this final rule) and “dynamic, non-static fashion,” the\nDepartment does not define these terms in the regulation. The Department recognizes\ncommenters’ concerns about the lack of standardization in the data sharing process; however, as\nwith other aspects of the data sharing requirement in the regulation, the Department believes that\nthe requirement is better suited to a performance-based, rather than prescriptive, standard. A\nmore performance-based framework could enable the marketplace to coalesce around several\nfunctioning models of data transfer that will work to meet the regulation’s objectives—namely,\nfor ticket agents to have access to ancillary fee information sufficient to meet the fee disclosure\nrequirements under this rule. We do note that, to meet the fee disclosure requirements of this\nfinal rule, ticket agents would need to be able to access fee rules and/or specific fee information\nsuch that each consumer itinerary search will result in the provision of accurate and applicable\ncritical ancillary fee information that this rule requires. The Department expects that this will\nmean automated data transfers rather than manual. We also note that the requirement is for\nairlines to provide information “sufficient to ensure compliance by such entities” with the\ndisclosure requirement. If airlines transfer the data in a way that is generally inaccessible to\nticket agents despite reasonable efforts by the ticket agents to incorporate the data into their\nsystems, then the information provided by the airlines is not considered sufficient. We expect\nboth airlines and ticket agents to work in good faith to ensure that the data is useable to the\nrecipient. Understanding that smaller ticket agents may require additional time to modify their\nsystems to receive data and to disclose fee information in accordance with the regulation, this\nrule provides for additional time for small ticket agents to come into compliance. See section F.\nThe Department has considered ticket agents’ concern that they could be held liable for\nmissing or inaccurate data provided by the airlines. After considering these comments, the\nDepartment has determined that this concern is best addressed through OACP’s investigatory\nprocess since OACP would be able to determine whether ticket agents’ failure to properly\ndisclose fees is a result of receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from an airline, based on the\nspecific facts and circumstances of each case. The disclosures required by this rulemaking apply\nto both airlines and ticket agents. Under the regulation, if OACP were to investigate and find that\nmissing or erroneous fee information displayed on a ticket agent’s website was entirely the result\nof airline action or inaction, then OACP would pursue action against the airline and not the ticket\nagent. This rule affords airlines flexibility on how fee information is transmitted to ticket agents\n(i.e., whether the airline decides to use direct connect, GDS, or another method of delivery) but\nalso requires airlines to ensure that information is accurately, timely, and effectively transmitted.\n(9) Remedies for Noncompliance\nProposal: The Department proposed to treat as an unfair and deceptive practice within\nthe meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712: (1) the failure by a carrier or ticket agent to provide the critical\nancillary fee disclosures required by the proposed rule, and (2) the collection of a fee for critical\nancillary services if that fee was not disclosed when fare and schedule information was provided.\nIn addition, the Department proposed to require a seller of air transportation to refund any fee\ncharged for a critical ancillary service if the fee was not disclosed at the time the consumer\nsearched for and purchased air transportation.\nComments: The Department received only a few comments directly addressing these\nproposed provisions, all from industry commenters who opposed the requirement for a ticket\nagent to refund fees charged by an airline. USTOA stated that the proposed requirement for\nticket agents to provide refunds for services actually provided, in contrast to refunds for services\nnot provided, exceeds the Department’s statutory authority. This comment asserted that the\nDepartment is authorized to issue civil penalties for violations of 49 U.S.C. 41712, but not\nequitable relief like disgorgement, and the comment urged the Department to rely on\ninvestigations and civil penalties to incentivize compliance. USTOA also raised concerns about\nthe burdens of retaining information to demonstrate what critical ancillary fee information was\nprovided to the consumer at the time of search. Similarly, ASTA raised concerns with the\npurported challenges of demonstrating what was disclosed by the ticket agent to a consumer in\nan offline transaction and the burden of providing refunds for funds collected by the airline, not\nthe ticket agent. Finally, Google stated that an entity that displays and relies on ancillary fee\ninformation provided by an airline should not be liable for a later overcharge by the airline and\nexpressed concern that the proposal was likely to impose “a severe financial burden on ticket\nagents.” Google added that metasearch entities would need to collect and retain personal\ninformation for purposes of issuing a refund and would not be able to validate data provided by a\nconsumer, such as frequent flier status, that may result in an airline charging a higher fee than\nwas originally displayed.108\nDOT Response: After carefully considering the comments, the Department is maintaining\nits proposal to treat as an unfair and deceptive practice the failure by a carrier or ticket agent to\nprovide and adhere to the critical ancillary fee disclosures required by this rule but is not moving\nforward with its proposal to require a seller of air transportation to refund a fee for any critical\nancillary service charged if the fee was not disclosed at the time the consumer searched for and\npurchased air transportation. While the Department disagrees with USTOA’s comment that the\nproposed remedy exceeds DOT’s authority, the Department has determined that any violations of\nthe disclosure requirements can be adequately addressed through its existing enforcement\nprocess, which can be initiated by a consumer’s filing of a complaint through OACP’s website.\nThe Department notes that, as an enforcement policy, OACP ensures that the violating entity has\ncorrected the problematic issue and made whole any consumer that was negatively impacted.\n108 Google noted that the proposed rule’s preamble stated that the refund would be owed by the “seller of air\ntransportation,” but the draft regulatory text did not use this term and instead referred to a refund by a “ticket agent,”\nwhich the Department has previously asserted includes metasearch entities.\nThis includes the Department seeking monetary relief for consumers in negotiated settlement\nagreements addressing violations of 49 U.S.C. 41712, where appropriate. The Department has\nobtained monetary relief for consumers in previous enforcement matters in addition to assessing\ncivil monetary penalties. See 49 U.S.C. 46301.\n(10) Other Proposals\n(a) Air Tour Packages\nProposal: The Department proposed that the fee disclosures for a carry-on bag, a first\nchecked bag, and a second checked bag under the NPRM would not apply to air-tour packages\nadvertised or sold online by ticket agents if the air transportation component is not finalized and\nthe carrier providing air transportation is not known at the time of booking. Instead, the\nDepartment proposed to require ticket agents in such situations to disclose that additional airline\nfees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the\npassenger’s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other information specific to the\nconsumer. The Department further proposed that, once the identity of the carrier providing the\nair transportation becomes known, the ticket agent must provide passenger-specific fee\ninformation for a first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag to prospective passengers and\nthose passengers who booked the air-tour package before the identity of the carrier was known.\nThe Department requested comment on whether this exception for certain air tour packages\nadequately addresses concerns of air-tour package sellers and whether such an exception\nadequately protects consumers.\nComments: American Airlines opposed the Department’s proposal to require sellers of air\ntour packages to state “baggage fees may apply” if the carrier is unknown at the time of booking.\nAsserting that the Department is essentially exempting air tour package sellers from the\nrequirement to disclose baggage fees, American recommended that sellers of air tour packages\ninstead be required to provide a range of baggage fees when a carrier’s identity is unknown.\nAmerican Airlines argued that the Department’s proposal would expand a technology gap to the\ndetriment of consumers, adding that “packagers are capable of providing reasonable estimates or\nranges for potential expenses for travelers. These requirements would increase transparency and\ncost certainty for travelers.” USTOA supported the Department’s proposal but noted that the\nNPRM did not specify the timeframe within which a ticket agent must provide the required\nbaggage fee disclosures to consumers after the identity of the air carrier becomes known.\nDOT Response: The Department disagrees with American Airlines’ assertion that the\nDepartment is exempting air tour package sellers from baggage fee disclosure requirements. The\nDepartment is adopting the proposal requiring that air tour package sellers provide the relevant\nfee information once the identity of the carrier is known. The rule does not require that air tour\npackage sellers disclose specific bag fees at the time of sale when the identity of the airline is not\nknown, as identifying specific bag fees without knowing the operating airline could lead to\nguessing and inaccurate information, thereby confusing consumers. The Department has long\nrequired carriers and ticket agents to provide specific fees for first checked, second checked, and\ncarry-on baggage, even under existing regulations that permit other ancillary fees to be expressed\nas a range. Baggage fees across carriers vary significantly and so requiring air tour package\nsellers to provide a range of baggage fees, as American Airlines recommends, would not assist\nconsumers to assess the costs of transportation as the range of baggage fees for multiple carriers\nwould be so wide as to render the information useless.\nUnder this final rule, if the airline for an air-tour package is unknown when a passenger\nbooks the package, then the ticket agent must disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner at the\ntime that the ticket agent first offers a package fare quotation that additional airline fees for\nbaggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced based on the passenger’s frequent flyer\nstatus, method of payment, or other consumer information. In addition, in response to the\ncomment from USTOA, this final rule clarifies that, once the identity of the airline for a tour\npackage is known, the ticket agent must provide the baggage fee disclosures otherwise required\nby this final rule at the same time that the ticket agent discloses the name of the carrier to the\npassenger.\nThe failure to disclose that additional baggage fees may apply when a passenger books an\nair tour package without an identifiable carrier and the failure to disclose the passenger-specific\nfees for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag when the carrier is known is\nunfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably\navoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. This practice\nis likely to cause substantial injury because of the additional funds spent to transport bags that\nmight have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up\nfront. This harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers likely will not know that the bag\nfees are not included without the disclosure that there may be additional bag fees. Also,\nconsumers would not know the cost of the bag fee without the ticket agent sharing that\ninformation with the passenger when the carrier is identified. Further, the harm is not outweighed\nby benefits to consumers or competition as the disclosures would ensure consumers are making\ninformed decisions and would enhance competition. It is also deceptive to fail to disclose that\nbag fees may apply when the carrier is not known and to fail to disclose the passenger-specific\nfees when the carrier is known. Without these disclosures, a reasonable consumer is likely to be\nmisled to believe that baggage fees were included in the price and also misled about the total\npurchase price. This matter is material as it impacts consumers’ funds.\nAir tour package sellers should provide consumers the opportunity to modify their air\ntour package at no cost or to cancel their air tour package for a refund, if the consumer chooses,\nonce the applicable bag fees are disclosed to the consumer.\n(b) 24-Hour Rule Disclosure\nProposal: The Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents with websites\nmarketed to U.S. consumers to display on the last page of the booking process a brief statement\non whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer’s booking to be cancelled without\npenalty within 24 hours, or whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer to hold the\nreservation without payment for 24 hours, provided that the reservation was made at least one\nweek before the flight’s departure. Carriers are already required to either permit consumers to\ncancel their tickets within 24 hours without penalty or hold their reservations at the quoted fare\nfor 24 hours without payment if the reservation is made more than a week before the flight’s\ndeparture. Similar requirements currently do not exist for ticket agents though agents may do so\nvoluntarily. This proposal is that the carrier’s and ticket agent’s chosen policy be disclosed on\nthe last page of the booking process, which is distinct from the existing requirement that the\ncarrier’s chosen policy (i.e., 24-hour hold or cancel within 24 hours with no penalty) be disclosed\nin that carrier’s customer service plan pursuant to 14 CFR 259.5.\nComments: The Department received few comments on this issue and those comments\neither supported the Department’s proposal or were neutral. For example, IdeaWorks, a\nconsulting firm, agreed that “[a]wareness of this benefit should be reinforced.” In addition, IATA\nnoted that it had no objection to the requirement for carriers to display the 24-hour cancellation\npolicy on their websites, while USTOA stated that it did not object to the new requirement\nprovided that the final rule was clear that ticket agents are not required to allow passengers to\ncancel a booking within 24 hours or to hold the ticket for 24 hours at the quoted price.\nDOT Response: The Department adopts this proposal with three clarifying edits. As\nproposed, this final rule requires carriers to disclose on the last page of the booking process\nwhether the consumer’s booking can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase without penalty or\nwhether it can be held at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment. The Department clarifies\nthat this disclosure must be made only if the reservation is made at least one week before the\nflight’s departure, consistent with the existing regulatory requirement for carriers in 14 CFR\n259.5(b)(4). Ticket agents are required to provide the same disclosure of their policy on allowing\na passenger to hold a reservation for 24 hours or cancel a reservation within 24 hours without a\npenalty, for flights departing one week or more after the reservation. Ticket agents that do not\noffer either the 24-hour free cancellation or 24-hour reservation hold options without charge\nmust disclose before ticket purchase that the consumer will not be able to cancel his or her\nbooking after it is executed, consistent with this rule. The Department has an open rulemaking\nthat would address, among other things, requiring travel agents to adopt minimum customer\nstandards such as the 24-hour rule similar to those imposed on carriers.109 The Department\nclarifies in this rule that airlines and ticket agents must make the required disclosure in a clear\nand conspicuous manner. In addition, the Department is amending the requirement for carriers to\ninclude an assurance in their customer service plan that they will offer either a 24-hour free\ncancellation or 24-hour reservation hold option at no cost to also include an assurance to disclose\ntheir chosen 24-hour policy on the last page of the booking process before ticket purchase as\nrequired in this rule. The Department has determined that the failure to make the required\ndisclosure before ticket purchase is an unfair and deceptive practice, as discussed in section D\n(1)(b).\n(c) E-Ticket Confirmations\nProposal: Section 399.85(c) currently requires air carriers and ticket agents to include\ninformation regarding the passenger’s free baggage allowance and the specific fee information\nfor first and second checked bags and a carry-on item on all e-ticket confirmations for air\ntransportation, taking into account factors such as frequent flyer status that affect those charges.\nThis regulation currently provides that carriers must provide this information in text form on the\ne-ticket confirmation. Agents may provide this information either in text form on the e-ticket\nconfirmations or through a hyperlink to the specific location on an airline website or their own\nwebsite where this information is displayed. In the NPRM, the Department requested comment\non whether there is a benefit in retaining these requirements.\n109 Information on the rulemaking titled “Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents”\n(RIN 2015-AE57) is available in the Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Action at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57.\nComments: Few commenters addressed this issue. A4A urged DOT to remove the e-\nticket disclosure because, in its view, existing disclosures are “redundant, unnecessary, and\nburdensome” and because consumers would have already received the information required in\nthe e-ticket confirmation during the search process.110 On the other hand, AARP called the e-\nticket confirmation “an essential element of consumer protection.” AARP further noted that “the\ndates of travel may be weeks or months after the tickets were booked, and many consumers will\nhave forgotten the specific fee amounts presented to them at the time of booking,” making the e-\nticket confirmation “an important record for consumers to have at the time of travel.”\nFlyersRights asked the Department to require additional disclosure after ticket purchase of the\nsize limitations for personal items, carry-on bags, checked bags, instruments, and sporting\nequipment.\nDOT Response: The Department maintains in this final rule, with modifications, the\nrequirements that carriers and ticket agents must include specific fee information for first and\nsecond checked bags and a carry-on item on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation and\nthat the fee information provided must take into account the passenger-specific factors that affect\nthose charges. The Department agrees with AARP that the e-ticket confirmation serves as a\nvaluable record for consumers concerning the fee information provided at the time of booking\nand disagrees with A4A that listing this information on the e-ticket is redundant or burdensome.\nTo ensure that the e-ticket provides an accurate record of the fees disclosed to consumers at the\ntime of purchase, the Department is removing the allowance for ticket agents to provide a link to\nbaggage fees as an alternative to providing the information in text form.\n110 In its comment, A4A also asked DOT to eliminate the existing requirement at 14 CFR 399.85(b) that U.S.\ncarriers, foreign air carriers, agents of either, and ticket agents provide a prominent disclosure that “additional bag\nfees may apply” and where consumers can see these baggage fees. The Department proposed to replace that existing\nrequirement with the requirement to disclose itinerary-specific or passenger-specific fees, depending upon the\nconsumer’s search type, for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag. The final rule removes the\nexisting requirement as proposed. Requirements for the display of baggage fees under this final rule are discussed in\nsection E (4).\nThe Department has determined that it is an unfair practice to provide links to bag fees in\nthe e-ticket confirmation instead of providing the information in text form. Links to bag fees that\nlead to complex charts are confusing to consumers and may ultimately not be instructive for\nmany consumers in determining the bag fee that would apply to them. Further, the lack of an e-\nticket confirmation with the bag fee in text form is likely to cause substantial injury for\nconsumers who are charged a bag fee that is higher than the one disclosed during the search\nprocess because consumers would lack a valuable record to demonstrate the fee information\nprovided at the time of booking. This harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers are\nnot able to generate the confirmation on their own. Also, the harm that these consumers\nexperience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because lack of clarity\nabout applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, consumers, and competition. As such, the\nDepartment is imposing in this final rule the same requirement for ticket agents to display\nbaggage fees in text form on the e-ticket confirmation that has traditionally applied to carriers. In\nresponse to the comment from FlyersRights, the Department also clarifies that the information\nabout the passenger’s free baggage allowance currently required to be included in the e-ticket\nconfirmation must include information about a personal item. This is not a substantive change to\nexisting requirements.\n(d) Bag Policy Change Disclosures\nProposal: The existing regulation at 14 CFR 399.85(a) requires carriers to disclose any\nincrease in applicable fees for carry-on or first or second checked bags promptly and\nprominently, along with any change in baggage allowances, on the homepages of their websites\nfor at least three months after the change becomes effective. In the NPRM, the Department\nproposed language changes to clarify the scope of websites covered by this existing requirement\nbut did not propose substantive changes. DOT also requested comment on whether these\nrequirements would still be useful to consumers if the NPRM was finalized.\nComments: The Department received few comments on this issue. One individual stated\nthat additional guidance on how airlines should communicate baggage fee increases to\nconsumers is needed. A4A urged the Department to remove this required disclosure because it\nwould be redundant and unnecessary if the rule were adopted as proposed.\nDOT Response: The Department agrees with A4A that the existing requirement to\ndisclose baggage fee increases and changes in baggage allowances on the carrier’s homepage is\nno longer necessary. Under this final rule, airlines and ticket agents must provide the consumer\nwith passenger-specific or itinerary-specific fees, depending on the consumer’s search type, for a\nfirst checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag when a fare and itinerary is\ndisplayed in response to a consumer’s search. As discussed in section E (10)(e), under 14 CFR\n399.88, these fees may not increase from what was displayed to the consumer before ticket\npurchase. Applicable baggage fees must also be memorialized on the e-ticket confirmation.\nAccordingly, prominent disclosure of baggage fee increases on carriers’ websites would be\nunnecessary under this final rule because carriers may not apply such increases to ticketed\npassengers.111\n(e) Post Purchase Price Increases\nProposal: The Department proposed to amend 14 CFR 399.88, which prohibits sellers of\nair transportation from increasing the price for air transportation including the price for ancillary\nservices that have not yet been purchased after a ticket is purchased, except in the case of an\nincrease in a government-imposed tax or fee or if the potential for an increase was disclosed as\nrequired prior to purchase. Although the existing regulation includes a broad prohibition on\nincreases to all ancillary service fees, regardless of whether these items are purchased along with\nthe air transportation, in 2011, the Department announced that with respect to fees for ancillary\n111 In response to the individual commenter, the Department notes that the post-purchase price increase prohibition\nat 14 CFR 399.88 does not prohibit an airline from charging different fees for a first-checked, second-checked, or\ncarry-on bag based on when the passenger pays the baggage fee (e.g., in advance or at the airport), but that it instead\nprohibits airlines from changing baggage fee rules that apply when a ticket is purchased.\nservices that were not purchased with the air transportation, it would only enforce the prohibition\non post-purchase price increases for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags.112 The\napplication of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was also at issue in a lawsuit\nfiled by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the\nDepartment’s 2011 guidance and upheld the Department’s rule prohibiting post purchase price\nincreases as it is currently being applied.113 The proposed revisions were intended to make the\nregulatory text consistent with the Department’s rule as applied under the Department’s 2011\nguidance and upheld by the Court.\nThe Department did not propose changes to the rule as it is applied but sought comment\non whether it should require that the price for ancillary services not purchased with the ticket be\nfrozen beyond first and second checked bag and a carry-on item. More specifically, the\nDepartment asked whether prohibition on post purchase price increase should extend to fees for\nall baggage (including fees for oversized or overweight bags) or all ancillary services that have\nbeen identified as being critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision.\nComments: IATA and American Airlines opposed any expansion of the post-purchase\nprice increase beyond the fees for first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag.\nCiting seat fees as one example, American Airlines stated that many ancillary fees are\ndynamically priced, and so prohibiting post-purchase increase of those fees “would have the\nunintended consequence of foreclosing discounts for early purchases and likely result in\nincreased prices.”\nAARP and FlyersRights commented on this proposal on behalf of consumers. AARP\nstated that the prohibition should apply to “the ancillary fees covered by this rule” and added that\nallowing fees to increase at a later date would undermine the regulatory goal of enabling\n112 See Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket (December 28,\n2011).\n113 Spirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20–21. Petition for Writ\nof Certiorari denied on Apr. 1, 2013.\nconsumers to make informed purchasing decisions based on the full cost of travel. FlyersRights\nadvocated for extending the post-purchase price increase prohibition to all ancillary fees, not\nonly those critical ancillary fees required to be displayed by this rule. This commenter stated that\nfees advertised at the time of ticket sale should not be increased once a consumer is locked into a\nticket purchase.\nDOT Response: The final rule extends the post-purchase price increase prohibition to all\nfees for critical ancillary services. The Department notes that, in addition to the post-purchase\nprice increase prohibition on fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage, as\ncurrently applied and discussed above, change and cancellation fees may not be increased\nbeyond what was disclosed to the consumer at the time of purchase under 14 CFR 253.7.\nBecause the only critical ancillary services identified in this final rule are first checked, second\nchecked, and carry-on baggage and ticket changes and cancellations, the modification from the\nproposal to cover all critical ancillary service fees does not impose any new burdens on carriers\nor ticket agents. If the Department identifies additional critical ancillary services, after notice and\nopportunity for comment, then the post-purchase price increase prohibition will apply to those\nservices at that time. The Department declines to extend the prohibition to additional ancillary\nfees not critical to a consumer’s purchasing decision at this time due to the complexity and\ndynamic nature of many ancillary services. For example, as noted by the airlines, some airlines\noffer dynamic seat fee pricing that may adjust based on demand and availability, and consumers\nrelying on a specific seat fee may be confused if the seat associated with that fee is no longer\navailable by the time the consumer is ready to purchase a seat assignment. As another example,\nfreezing the price of inflight food offerings at the time of ticket purchase could cause different\npassengers to have different pricing regarding the same food product purchased at the same time,\na situation which could cause consumer confusion and be difficult for airlines to manage.\n(f) Full Fare Rule and Percentage Off Discounts\nProposal: The Department proposed non-substantive changes to the current “full fare”\nrequirement in 14 CFR 399.84(a) that when a carrier or ticket agent quotes a price in advertising\nor a solicitation, the price must be the total fare, inclusive of taxes and fees. The proposed\nchanges consisted of minor changes to § 399.84(a) to promote readability and accommodate the\nancillary fee disclosures proposed in the NPRM. Specifically, the Department proposed that, if a\nconsumer wishes to view ancillary service fees, such as bag fees, incorporated into the total\nquoted price during an itinerary search, carriers and ticket agents may display the total price of\nthe transportation, inclusive of mandatory taxes and fees and the consumer’s selected ancillary\nservice fees, more prominently than a price that includes only all mandatory charges. These\nadjustments were not intended to make substantive changes to the full fare rule.\nUnder the existing full fare rule, carriers and ticket agents may state separately any\ncharges included within the single total price on their websites, but such charges may not be false\nor misleading, may not be displayed more prominently than the total price, may not be presented\nin the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per-passenger\nbasis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge. Consistent with this\nrequirement, the Department explained that advertisements that state discounts in the form of\npercentage-off sales must refer to a discount off the total price to be paid by the consumer for the\nticket, unless the airline or ticket agent explicitly states that the discount is based on only a\nportion of the fare. For example, an advertisement that indicates air transportation is on sale for a\npercentage off but does not apply the discount to the total price would be misleading if it did not\nspecify that it is a percentage off only the “base fare” or other fare component. The Department\nfurther elaborated that, when the terms “flight,” “ticket,” or “fare” are used in an advertisement\nstating a percentage off (e.g., “a 25% discount off the flight”), a reasonable consumer would\nunderstand that the percentage off applies to the total price of the transportation. In the NPRM,\nthe Department explained that there is a lack of clarity about the meaning of the term “base fare”\nand offering a percentage discount off of the “base fare” may be misleading if the discount only\napplies to a portion of the carrier-imposed charges, and not the total amount of carrier-imposed\ncharges (i.e., the fare for the transportation plus carrier-imposed charges such as fuel surcharges\nand other mandatory carrier fees). The Department solicited comment on whether and how to\naddress this issue in the final rule.\nComments: Several commenters representing both industry and consumers asked the\nDepartment to define “base fare” to mean all mandatory carrier-imposed charges and agreed with\nthe Department’s assessment in the NPRM that providing a “base fare” discount would be\nmisleading if the base fare did not include all such mandatory charges. For example, Southwest\nAirlines stated that some airlines advertise “generous eye-catching percentage-off discounts that\ncan be fairly described as ‘bait-and-switch’ tactics” of a large percentage off a low “base fare”\nthat does not include all mandatory carrier-imposed fees. Southwest explained that in such\ncircumstances mandatory carrier-imposed fees “often make up the majority of the ticket price”\nand are not discounted. In addition, both Travelers United and Southwest Airlines requested that\nDOT clarify that the “base fare” must include all mandatory airline-imposed fees on the\ndistribution channel where a fare is viewed (e.g., if there is a charge for online booking and the\nconsumer is searching for airfare online, then the online booking fee must be included in the base\nfare). A small travel agent asked the Department to go further and prohibit all fuel surcharges\nand carrier-imposed fees, stating that fares are filed to ATPCO with the base fare only, making it\ndifficult to compare fares between carriers. On the other hand, IATA opposed any additional\nregulation in this area, stating that consumers understand that percentage-off discount offers do\nnot discount carrier surcharges.\nRegarding the existing full fare rule, a joint comment from multiple State attorneys\ngeneral noted that airlines often charge fees in connection with different methods of booking,\nincluding online, telephone, or in-person booking fees. These commenters noted that they\nunderstand that the existing full fare rule already requires such fees to be included in the full fare,\nbut asked DOT to cover such fees in this rulemaking in the event that this understanding was\nincorrect.\nDOT Response: In this final rule, the Department is permitting airlines and ticket agents\nto disclose a total price inclusive of mandatory taxes and fees and ancillary fees in place of or\nmore prominently than a total price that only includes all mandatory taxes and fees.\nIn response to comments, the Department is adding a new paragraph (e) to § 399.84,\nwhich provides that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to offer a\npercentage-off discount for air transportation, a tour, or a tour component that does not make\nclear at the outset the terms and conditions of the offer, including how the discount is calculated.\nThis new provision further provides that, when used in any advertising or solicitation, the term\n“base fare” must refer to the amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed charges. The\nDepartment agrees with commenters that an advertisement of a percentage-off discount that is\nunclear about its terms or is offered as a percentage off a “base fare” that does not include all\nmandatory carrier-imposed charges is unfair and deceptive to consumers. The Department is\nunpersuaded by IATA’s unsupported statement that consumers understand that base fare\ndiscounts do not include discounts off carrier-imposed surcharges, particularly as to those\nconsumers who purchase air transportation infrequently. The Department notes that carriers and\nticket agents may continue to list the components of the “base fare” separately, consistent with §\n399.84(a).\nAlso, as requested in a joint comment from multiple State attorneys general, the\nDepartment is making clear that mandatory booking charges are required to be included in the\nquoted fare under the full fare rule. Southwest Airlines and Traveler’s United also requested\nconfirmation that if there is a charge for online booking and the consumer is searching for airfare\nonline, then the online booking fee must be included in the base fare. That is correct. As the\nDepartment explained when it issued its final rule that addresses full fare advertising in 2011,\nwhile a carrier or ticket agent generally is not required to include a booking fee in its advertised\nfare if there are other means for the passenger to obtain the air transportation (e.g., a booking fee\nonly applies for tickets that are purchased over the telephone), where airfares are advertised via\nan Internet site that permits consumers to purchase fares, the fares advertised on the site must\ninclude all charges required to make the purchase on the site. For example, it would be unfair\nand deceptive to hold out on such an Internet site a fare that can be purchased only at airport\nticket counters but that excludes a convenience fee that is applied to Internet sales.114 To avoid\nconfusion in this area, the Department is adding this clarification to its full fare rule.\n(g) Codeshare Flights\nProposal: The Department did not propose any new requirements specific to codeshare\nflights, separate from the general proposal that airlines and ticket agents disclose critical\nancillary fees on an itinerary-specific basis.\nComments: A comment from multiple State attorneys general stated that “where there is a\ncodeshare arrangement in place, the consumer must be notified of the fees that will actually be\ncharged, whether they are imposed by the airline through which the consumer booked the flight\nor the airline operating the flight.” Though this comment noted that the issue appeared to be\naddressed by the requirement that the fees provided be accurate, these commenters asked DOT to\nconsider whether special requirements were necessary for codeshare flights. Two individual\ncommenters similarly stated that carriers should be required to disclose the fees of their partners.\nDOT Response: The Department has determined that no revisions to the proposed rule are\nnecessary to address these comments. The Department proposed, and this final rule requires, that\nairlines and ticket agents disclose critical ancillary fees on an itinerary-specific basis. This\nincludes the requirement in §399.85(c) of this rule for a carrier to accurately display itinerary-\nspecific fees, including those involving flights operated by a partner carrier. In addition, this final\nrule maintains the existing regulatory requirement in §399.85(e) (recodified in this rule at\n§399.85(i)) that airlines must disclose through their websites any differences between their\n114 76 FR 23110, 23143 (Apr. 25, 2011).\noptional services and related fees and those of a carrier operating the flight under a codeshare\narrangement. This existing requirement includes the fees for ancillary services that are not\ncovered by the requirements of this final rule. This final rule also maintains the existing\nregulatory requirement in 14 CFR 399.87 that, for passengers whose ultimate ticketed origin or\ndestination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees\nthat apply at the beginning of a passenger’s itinerary throughout his or her entire itinerary. That\nsection also specifies that, in the case of code-share flights that form part of an itinerary whose\nultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the\nbaggage allowances and fees of the marketing carrier throughout the itinerary to the extent that\nthey differ from those of any operating carrier.\n(h) Additional Comments\nThe Department received several comments that did not specifically address the\nproposals in the NPRM.\nComment: Google noted that the NPRM did not address how the proposed requirements\nwould affect existing requirements at 14 CFR part 256 governing how ticket agents and air\ncarriers must respond to consumer searches and disclose display bias. Specifically, Google asked\nwhether fees for baggage, ticket changes and cancellations, and seat assignments should be\nincluded in the total price when ranking responses based on the lowest total price.\nDOT Response: The Department’s existing regulation at 14 CFR 256.4 prohibits\nundisclosed display bias and requires each electronic airline information system to “display\ninformation in an objective manner based on search criteria selected by the user;” the regulation\nprovides “lowest total cost” as one example of search criterion. This regulation further requires\nthat those flight options best satisfying the user’s selected search criteria “must be ranked in lists\nabove other flight options,” but provides that this “does not preclude systems from setting default\ndisplay parameters that are not deceptive or offering users the option to choose a variety of\ndisplay methods within those parameters.”\nThe Department clarifies that this final rule does not alter the existing requirements in\npart 256. If an airline or ticket agent’s site enables a consumer to select desired ancillary services\n(e.g., baggage) to be included in the total quoted price for search results and the consumer\nrequests to receive search results by “lowest total cost,” then any ancillary fees selected by the\npassenger should be included in the total price for purposes of ranking flight options to reflect\nthe consumer’s selected search parameters.\nComments: FlyersRights and multiple State attorneys general stated that states should be\nprovided with statutory authority to regulate aviation consumer protection.\nDOT Response: This issue is outside the Department’s authority and cannot be addressed\nby the Department in this final rule. The Department works with state authorities on aviation\nconsumer protection issues where appropriate and within the confines of existing statutory\nauthority.115\nComment: The U.S. PIRG Education Fund asked the Department to update its method of\nreporting consumer complaints, suggesting models currently used by the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\nDOT Response: The Department has been examining how best to review, process, and\nreport air travel service consumer complaints, which has included looking at various models\nincluding models currently used by NHTSA and CFPB. The Department anticipates that its new\nmodernized system will be operational in 2024 and will be further enhanced with funding from\nthe Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) in the coming years.\nComments: A few individual commenters asked the Department to impose a\ncomprehensive passengers’ bill of rights.\n115\nOn April 16, 2024, the Department announced a new partnership with State attorneys general to prioritize\nmisconduct cases referred to DOT by State attorneys general who uncover unfair or deceptive airline practices. See\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-buttigieg-launches-bipartisan-partnership-state-attorneys-\ngeneral-protect.\nDOT Response: This comment is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. The Department\nnotes that it provides a comprehensive list of current consumer protections for air consumers at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights and an Airline Passengers with\nDisabilities Bill of Rights at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/disabilitybillofrights.\nAlso, the Department has an open rulemaking to respond to section 429 of the 2018 FAA Act\nwhich directs the Department to require carriers to submit a one-page document that describes\nthe rights of air consumers to the agency and require those carriers to make that document\navailable on their websites.116\nF. Compliance Period\nProposal: The Department proposed a six-month implementation period for the rule’s\nrequirements. In support of the proposed six-month implementation period, the Department\nnoted that, at the June 2022 ACPAC meeting, one airline representative indicated that, broadly\nspeaking, sharing ancillary fee data with ticket agents is not technologically difficult and could\nbe accomplished within a short time frame.117 The Department specifically sought comment on\nwhether it should impose a date certain by which carriers must share ancillary service fee\ninformation with ticket agents.\nComments: The ACPAC decided to refrain from recommending a specific timeframe for\ncompliance with the final rule. Instead, the ACPAC recommended at its January 12, 2023,\nmeeting that the Department should consider what can be done realistically, as well as the need\nfor consumers to have ancillary fee information as soon as possible, in determining the\ntimeframe for compliance with the final rule.\nA few groups representing consumers requested that the Department adopt either the six-\nmonth period from the NPRM or a shorter three-month implementation period. For example,\n116 “One-Page Document on Passenger Rights” (RIN 2015-AE82) is available in the Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of\nRegulatory and Deregulatory Action at\nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE82.\n117 Remark of American Airlines, available at\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 afternoon session).\nAARP supported the proposed six-month compliance period, calling it a “reasonable amount of\ntime” and urged the Department to finalize and implement the rule quickly “so that the benefits\nof fee disclosure can be extended to travelers as soon as possible.” In addition, FlyersRights\nasked the Department to instead require a three-month implementation period. In support, it cited\nthe June 2022 ACPAC testimony that the Department cited in the NPRM as evidence that\nairlines and ticket agents could implement the proposed rule more quickly. On the other hand,\nTravelers United commented that the significant technological changes required by the proposal\nwould require additional time to implement.\nIndustry commenters uniformly opposed the proposed six-month compliance period,\nstating that it was far too short and recommending significantly longer periods, with many\nstating at least three years was needed. Specifically, industry commenters raised concerns with\nthe ability to complete data-sharing agreements, develop the proposed first page display of\ncritical ancillary fees, display real-time, transactable family seating fees, and calculate and\ndisplay passenger-specific fees within the six-month timeframe proposed. For example, A4A\nstated that a compliance period of at least three years was “necessary to provide time for all\nparties to re-engineer their own marketing platforms and re-design and re-engineer connections\nto other stake holders, especially with regard to family seating transactions and passenger-\nspecific search information.” IATA also recommended a three-year implementation period,\nciting prior challenges with data sharing using EDIFACT and testifying at the Department’s\nMarch 30, 2023, hearing that providing transactable family seating fees would take years. In\naddition, Frontier Airlines suggested that required data sharing with ticket agents “would be\nmeasured in years, and perhaps decades,” and American Airlines stated that “to disclose\npassenger-specific ancillary fees on the first page of search results requires a highly complex\nreconfiguration” of its distribution technology that “could take years to resolve.”\nOther industry commenters suggested less than three years was needed but still\nemphasized that implementation of the proposal would take longer than the six months proposed.\nFor example, USTOA recommended an implementation period of at least 18 months, Travelport\nsuggested a period of 24 months (with the first 12 months for data sharing) if the Department\nelected not to require data sharing with GDSs, and Travel Tech stated that at least two years\nwould be needed to display all critical ancillary fees at the first point in the search process where\nschedule and fare information is provided.\nSome industry commenters stated or suggested that their time estimates would be shorter\nif the Department modified its proposal. For example, American Airlines stated that if the\nDepartment allowed itinerary-specific disclosures later in the booking process, its “estimate\nwould change meaningfully.” Bookings Holdings commented that its three-year implementation\nestimate could be reduced to two years if the Department required data sharing through GDSs\nand to 18 months if the Department allowed affirmative opt-ins or static rollovers, links, or pop-\nups for the display of fees. Amadeus noted that “[r]evision of the rules to allow more flexible\ndisplays and to eliminate the proposed requirement that all critical fee data be provided on the\nfirst search results page will go far to allow for timely and cost-efficient implementation.” Travel\nTech stated that the rule could possibly be implemented in as few as 18 months with\nmodifications to the proposal.\nDOT Response: After carefully considering the comments received, the Department\nextends the proposed compliance period as follows: (1) airlines must share data with ticket\nagents as required in this rule not later than six months after this rule’s publication date, or\nOctober 30, 2024; (2) airlines must meet the critical ancillary service fee disclosure requirements\nnot later than 12 months after this rule’s publication date, or April 30, 2025; (3) ticket agents that\ndo not meet the SBA definition of a small entity118 must meet the critical ancillary service fee\ndisclosure requirements to consumers not later than 18 months after this rule’s publication date,\nor October 30, 2025; and (4) ticket agents that meet the SBA definition of small entity must meet\n118 A ticket agent is a small entity if it has total annual revenues below $25 million See\nhttps://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards, NAICS Code 561510.\ncritical ancillary fee disclosure requirements to consumers not later than 24 months after this\nrule’s publication date, or April 30, 2026. The additional six months for large ticket agents to\ncomply beyond the deadline for airlines reflects that carriers already have access to the required\nancillary fee information, but ticket agents cannot implement the disclosure requirements in this\nrule until data-sharing arrangements are complete. The longer implementation period for small\nticket agents reflects that those businesses may require additional time for compliance as\ndiscussed in section E (1)(b).\nThe Department believes that the implementation period set forth in this final rule is\nreasonable. The Department has modified several key aspects of the proposal in this final rule,\n—including in areas that were of particular concern to industry commenters—which will permit\nquicker implementation than the periods generally suggested by industry commenters. Among\nthose significant changes, this final rule does not require display or transactability of family\nseating fees and provides additional flexibility in how critical ancillary fees must be disclosed, as\nrequested by many commenters. In addition, while some commenters cited the requirement to\nprovide passenger-specific fees as a challenge to timely implementation, the Department notes\nthat some commenters appeared to misunderstand this requirement and mistakenly believed that\ninformation provided by the consumer would need to be validated before the airline or ticket\nagent could disclose passenger-specific fees, posing technological challenges. As discussed in\nsection E (5), airlines and ticket agents may present passenger-specific ancillary fees based on\nthe information provided by the consumer, and so this requirement should not significantly slow\nimplementation.\nFinally, although this final rule does not require data sharing with GDSs as requested by\nsome commenters to speed implementation, the Department expects that airlines and ticket\nagents will work in good faith to come to an agreement on the method used to transmit the\nancillary fee information required by this final rule. Nothing in this final rule prevents airlines\nand ticket agents from voluntarily agreeing to use GDSs to distribute the ancillary fee\ninformation if that is their preferred method for meeting the rule’s requirements within the\ntimeframe provided.\nREGULATORY NOTICES\nExecutive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and\nProcedures\nThe final rule meets the threshold for a significant regulatory action as defined in section\n(3)(f)(1) of E.O. 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” as amended by E.O. 14094,\n“Modernizing Regulatory Review,” because it is likely to have an annual effect on the economy\nof $200 million or more. Accordingly, the Department has prepared a regulatory impact analysis\nfor the proposed rule, summarized in this section and available in the docket. Table X\nsummarizes the results of the analysis.\nThe final rule changes how U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents\ndisclose information about certain ancillary fees for flights. Expected benefits of the rule are due\nto the reduction of excess consumption of air travel, or deadweight loss, which occurs because\nconsumers who are unaware of ancillary service fees behave as if the price for air travel is lower\nthan it is. Annual benefits expected from reducing deadweight loss amount to $5.5 million. The\nother source of expected benefits is from the time consumers will save when they search for\nairfare because they no longer need to interrupt their search to find information on ancillary\nservice fees. The amount in expected benefits due to time savings varies significantly depending\non assumptions regarding the number of consumers who consider ancillary fee information when\nthey search for airfare.\nExpected costs of this rule include costs to consumers uninterested in receiving this\ninformation due to the time needed to navigate increased amounts of information, which again,\nvaries according to the percentage of consumers who consider ancillary fee information relevant\nto their purchase decision. The primary costs of the rule to carriers and ticket agents are the costs\nthat they would incur to modify their websites to adjust their displays of fares, schedules, and\nfees. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as GDSs and direct-channel companies might\nincur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though the Department understands that\nthese entities are already upgrading systems for market reasons and have been for several years.\nAs shown in table X, the analysis considered two scenarios, each representing an alternative\nestimate regarding the percentage of consumers who consider ancillary fee information when\nthey purchase airfare. Across the two scenarios, the estimate of annual net benefits ranges from\n$30 million to $254 million, indicating that this percentage is a key driver of the results. Formal\nuncertainty analysis suggests that the final rule might be expected to produce net societal benefits\nwith a probability of about 53 percent under plausible assumptions about the percentage of\nconsumers who consider ancillary fees when they purchase airfare.\nOne effect of better information on ancillary fees, however, is that some consumers will\npay less for the ancillary services they use when they travel by air. These economic effects are\nnot societal benefits or costs but represent a transfer from airlines to consumers, estimated to be\nabout $543 million annually. This transfer represents $543 million in overpayment in fees for\nconsumers, or from the perspective of airlines, additional revenue from consumers who are\nsurprised by fees and, for example, then need to pay a higher fee at the airport to check a bag.\nThis transfer, as well as the benefits due to any reduction in deadweight loss, accrue to\nconsumers and are expected to occur regardless of any time savings impacts.\nTable X: Summary of annual economic effects (millions of $2022)\nAnnual amount\nItem Scenario 1* Scenario 2**\nBenefits\nReduction in deadweight loss $5.5 $5.5\nReduction in search time for consumers interested in ancillary service fees $365.2 $484.3\nwhen they search for airline tickets on airline sites\nReduction in search time for consumers interested in ancillary service fees $37.4 $49.5\nwhen they search for airline tickets on non-airline sites\nTotal annualized benefits $408.1 $539.4\nCosts\nIncreased time navigating search results $330.8 $238.9\nAnnualized one-time and recurring costs for airlines to update price $32.1 $32.1\ndisplays and provide fee information to ticket agents\nAnnualized one-time and recurring costs for ticket agents to update price $13.9 $13.9\ndisplays\nAnnualized costs to ticket agents for offline disclosures $1.0 $1.0\nCosts to GDSs and other third-parties engaged in data exchange to\nUnquantified Unquantified\nupgrade systems\nTotal annualized costs $377.8 $285.9\nNet benefits (costs) $30.3 $253.5\nTransfers\nReduction in prices paid for ancillary services (airlines to consumers) $543.1 $543.1\n* Scenario 1: 46% of consumers consider ancillary fees when they search for airfare\n** Scenario 2: 61% of consumers consider ancillary fees when they search for airfare\nExecutive Order 13132 (Federalism)\nThis final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained\nin E.O. 13132 (“Federalism”). This final rule does not include any requirement that (1) has\nsubstantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the National Government and the\nStates, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government,\n(2) imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, or (3) preempts\nState law. States are already preempted from regulating in this area by the Airline Deregulation\nAct, 49 U.S.C. 41713. Therefore, the consultation and funding requirements of E.O. 13132 do\nnot apply.\nExecutive Order 13175\nThis final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained\nin E.O. 13175 (“Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments”). Because none\nof the provisions of this final rule will significantly or uniquely affect the communities of the\nIndian tribal governments or impose substantial direct compliance costs on them, the funding and\nconsultation requirements of E.O. 13175 do not apply.\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\nWhen a Federal agency is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C.\n553), the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the agency to\nconduct a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). A FRFA describes the impact of the rule\non small entities and describes the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant\neconomic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes (5\nU.S.C. 604). A FRFA is not required if the agency head certifies that a rule will not have a\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 605).\nThe Department has prepared a FRFA for this final rule, set forth in the paragraphs that follow.\nDOT has provided a statement of the need for, and objectives of, the rule elsewhere in the\npreamble and does not restate them here. In the preamble to this final rule, DOT responds to the\ncomments received on the economic impacts of the rule, including on small entities, and\nprovides DOT’s assessment of those comments and any changes made as a result of those\ncomments (e.g., the extended compliance period, exclusion of corporate travel agents, removal\nof family seat fee disclosure and transactability, flexibilities provided in the way carriers and\nticket agents display ancillary fee information, and permitting baggage and change and\ncancellation policies to be displayed later in the booking process). DOT does not repeat that\ninformation here. The Department’s Regulatory Impact Analysis developed in support of this\nfinal rule also provides information on the economic impacts of the final rule, as modified in\nresponse to public comments and further consideration by the Department. DOT did not receive\ncomments from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in\nresponse to the proposed rule.\nDescription of and an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply.\nThe rule will have some impact on U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers and ticket agents\nthat qualify as small entities. It would also have some impact on GDSs, but none of the three\nmajor GDS companies in the market (Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport) qualify as small\nbusinesses.\nA carrier is a small entity if it provides air transportation exclusively with small aircraft,\ndefined as any aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of 60 seats or\nless or a maximum payload capacity of 18,000 pounds or less, as described in 14 CFR 399.73. In\n2020, 28 carriers meeting these criteria reported passenger traffic data to the Bureau of\nTransportation Statistics.119\nA ticket agent is a small entity if it has total annual revenues below $25 million.120 This\namount excludes funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales\nsubject to commissions, but includes commissions received. In 2017, the latest year with\navailable data, 7,827 travel agency establishments had annual revenues of less than $25\nmillion.121\nDescription of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the\nrule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the\nrequirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record.\nThe final rule would have impacts on small entities because carriers and ticket agents\nwould incur costs to modify websites and upgrade systems to exchange ancillary fee data. The\nDepartment stated in its initial regulatory flexibility analysis prepared in support of the proposed\nrule that because the Department could not estimate these costs reliably, it could not determine\nwhether the proposed rule would impose a significant impact on a substantial number of small\nentities. For this final rule, the Department estimated that the primary costs of the rule to carriers\nand ticket agents are the costs that they would incur to modify their websites by adjusting their\ndisplays of fares, schedules, and fees. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as GDSs and\ndirect-channel companies might incur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though\n119 Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

DOT estimated quantified costs range from $658 million to $1.5\nbillion annually. The Department acknowledges that some portion of these costs would be\nincurred by small entities.\nDescription of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on\nsmall entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, including a statement of\nthe factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and\nwhy each one of the other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which\naffect the impact on small entities was rejected.\nThe Department considered several alternatives to the measures adopted in this final rule.\nIn this section, the Department describes the steps taken to minimize the significant economic\nimpact on small entities consistent with the objectives of 49 U.S.C. 41712 and the other\nauthorities discussed in the Statutory Authorities section of this final rule.\nThe Department proposed to cover U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents\nthat advertise or sell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies,\ncorporate travel agents, OTAs or metasearch sites that display airline flight search options\ndirectly to consumers. The final rule defers for a separate rulemaking a determination on whether\nmetasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents\nsubject to the disclosure requirements in this rule. To ensure consumers have access to critical\nancillary service fee information under this final rule while metasearch entities are excluded\nfrom the rule’s disclosure requirements, the Department requires that airlines and ticket agents\ndisplay the required critical ancillary service fee information on the landing page on the airline or\nticket agent’s online platform to which consumers are directed after using a metasearch site. The\nDepartment believes that this option best balances the concerns that more examination is needed\nin the Department’s separate rulemaking on ticket agents before the Department determines\nwhether to cover metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers\nas ticket agents required to disclose critical ancillary fee and policy information to consumers.\nThe final rule also excludes corporate travel agents from the final rule’s requirements.\nAncillary fee disclosures by those agents are the subject of contractual agreements between a\nbusiness client and the travel agent, with the relevant ancillary services and fees negotiated as\npart of the contract. Moreover, the fees often are irrelevant for corporate clients, and are not a\nsignificant consideration in corporate travelers’ purchasing decisions. The corporate client, not\nthe business traveler, generally pays the cost of transportation, including fees. The benefits of\ncovering corporate agents would therefore be limited but would involve costs.\nThe Department also considered differing compliance periods for the requirements\nestablished in the rule. In the proposed rule, the Department proposed a compliance period of 6\nmonths for all covered entities to comply with the rule’s requirements. The Department received\ncomment that additional time was needed for compliance, including from small entities. In\nconsideration of these comments, the Department requires in this final rule that: (1) airlines must\nprovide fee and policy information of critical ancillary services to entities required to disclose\nthis information directly to consumers no later than six months after this rule’s publication date,\n(2) airlines must comply with all other regulatory requirements not later than 12 months after this\nrule’s publication date, (3) ticket agents that do not meet the SBA definition of small entity must\ncomply with all regulatory requirements not later than 18 months after this rule’s publication\ndate, and (4) ticket agents that that meet the SBA definition of small entity must comply with all\nregulatory requirements not later than 24 months after this rule’s publication date.\nIn the proposed rule, DOT would have required airlines and ticket agents to provide fee\ninformation for first and second checked bags, carry-on bags, and change and cancellation fees in\ntext form next to the fare information provided to consumers. On consideration of comments that\nthe proposed requirements would result in screen clutter and be potentially confusing to\nconsumers, the Department determined in this final rule to allow fee information to be displayed\nusing pop-ups, expandable text, or other means except for hyperlinks as long as the disclosure is\nclear and conspicuous. This is intended to minimize clutter and allow airlines and ticket agents\nflexibility in how they disclose information. The Department also allows some information—\nspecifically, airline policies for baggage and ticket changes and cancellations—later in the\nprocess, as long as the disclosure occurs before ticket purchase. Policy information can be\ndisplayed using hyperlinks. The Department believes that these additional flexibilities will\nreduce costs to airlines and assist consumers because airlines will be able to present the\ninformation in a manner that, while clear and conspicuous, is not confusing to consumers.\nIn this final rule, the Department also made changes to the proposed requirements for\noffline disclosures. In the proposed rule, the Department required these disclosures to be made\nfor every quoted itinerary. The Department received comments that such disclosures would add a\nsignificant amount of “talk time” that would burden airlines and ticket agents with having to\nprovide the information and consumers with having to spend time listening to the disclosures\neven if the information was not relevant to them. As a result of these comments, the Department\nis finalizing a requirement that airlines and ticket agents inform consumers purchasing air travel\noffline about whether a critical ancillary fee applies to the itinerary being quoted and give the\nconsumer an opportunity to request information on the fee. The airline or ticket agent must then\nprovide the critical ancillary fee information upon request of the consumer. This modification is\nexpected to reduce extra time spent on the phone, which will benefit not only airlines and ticket\nagents, but also consumers who will not have to listen to information not relevant to them.\nThe Department considered whether to apply the disclosure requirements to all online\nplatforms, in addition to computer websites. The Department finalizes the requirement that the\ndisclosure requirements apply to all online platforms in this final rule. While this option may\nincrease costs, the Department determined that it was necessary to ensure consumers received the\nsame information on critical ancillary fees and policies regardless of the online platform used to\npurchase their tickets for air travel.\nDOT also considered whether to require disclosure of family seating fees in this\nrulemaking and to make those fees transactable by ticket agents. The Department is not\nfinalizing the proposal to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose applicable fees for\npassengers 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult on an aircraft, and to make\nthose fees transactable. Instead, the Department is pursuing a separate rulemaking to address the\nissue of a young child being able to sit adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional cost\nbeyond the fare. Not requiring family seating disclosures and fee transactability reduces the cost\nburden on airlines and ticket agents.\nPaperwork Reduction Act\nIn this final rule, the Department imposes new collections of information that require\napproval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act\nof 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13, 49 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The Department also amends an existing\ncollection of information, 2105-0561, in this final rule, with regard to the requirements for\ncustomer service plans. The Department has sought approval from OMB for the collections of\ninformation established in this final rule and will also seek approval for the amendment to the\ncollection approved under OMB Control No. 2105-0561 as part of the renewal of that OMB\ncontrol number, due to expire August 31, 2024. The Department will publish a separate notice in\nthe Federal Register announcing OMB approval of the new and amended collections and\nadvising the public of the associated OMB control numbers. Notwithstanding any other\nprovisions of law, no person shall be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a collection of\ninformation if the collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control\nnumber.\nIndustry commenters generally expressed the view that the proposed rule’s disclosure\nrequirements would impose significant burdens on industry. Many airlines stated that the\ndisclosure requirements would require a reconfiguration of their processes. A study of the NPRM\ncommissioned by A4A estimated $33 billion in costs to airlines over 10 years. A4A estimated\nthat the initial airline cost of implementation would be $86.5 million and $9 million annually for\nmaintenance and additional development. American Airlines stated that over 100,000\nengineering hours would be required to begin reworking the search process on the airline’s\ndesktop website and other platforms.\nBooking Holdings and USTOA stated that the Department’s PRA analysis in the NPRM\ngreatly underestimated burdens for planning, development, and programming by ticket agents to\nprovide online displays of ancillary fee information on their websites. In addition, Booking\nHoldings estimated that the initial costs of engineering and testing the required displays,\nincluding to ensure readability and timeliness, would be multiple millions of dollars per entity\ncovered by the regulation for initial development. Similarly, while USTOA did not provide an\nalternative burden hour estimate, USTOA stated that the 80 hours per entity that DOT estimated\nfor programming, data management, website modification, and other related costs was an\nunderestimate, given what it characterized as the “extensive and ongoing website revisions that\nwould be necessary to compile ancillary fee options,”122 and that the hourly wage of $45.90/hour\nused by the Department for web and interface designs was too low.123\nBooking Holdings and USTOA asserted that the Department was incorrect to assume no\ncosts for ongoing website maintenance by ticket agents. Instead, Booking Holdings estimated\nthat the proposal would impose annual maintenance costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars per\nentity/ticket agent, stating that the proposal would require ticket agents to employ “multiple full\ntime engineers/developers, a project manager, and a full-time quality assurance associate to\nensure that dynamic displays continue to operate appropriately” and to periodically update and\nmaintain hardware associated with the searches, for example, as carriers update and change their\nancillary service fee policies. Further, Booking Holdings stated that the Department failed to\naccount for any costs of negotiating new data-sharing agreements with carriers. A4A estimated\nthat $8.8 million would be spent to supply data to agents.\n122 USTOA further stated that the costs of complying with the full fare rule were not analogous to the costs of\ndisplaying complex ancillary fee information, as DOT suggested.\n123 USTOA stated that an inflation adjustment of the Department’s estimated hourly rate for such services from the\n2014 NPRM would result in an hourly of wage of $142.85/hour for a total annual cost to ticket agents of “at least\n$6,856,800.”\nIn USTOA’s view, the Department underestimated the number of ticket agents who\nwould be required to comply with the rule’s requirements, given the rule’s applicability to offline\ntransactions. USTOA and ASTA also disagreed with the Department’s assessment that orally\nconveying the proposed ancillary fee information in offline transactions would involve only a\n“marginal increase in time” with minimal burden. ASTA estimated that 17.2 million offline\ntransactions are completed each year by ticket agents and that the proposed disclosures for\noffline transactions would add at least 20 seconds to each offline transaction at an estimated cost\nof $21.3 million per year in “talk time” for ticket agents.\nThe Department has carefully considered public comments regarding the costs of the\ninformation collections required by this rule and reexamined the burden estimates presented in\nthis section in light of the regulatory impact analysis developed in support of the final rule. As\nnoted above, the Department has made modifications in this final rule that may have differing\neffects on the information collection burdens implicated by the NPRM. In contrast to the NPRM,\nthe final rule does not impose a requirement to disclose family seating fees and provides\nadditional flexibility in how critical ancillary fee information is disclosed and when policy\ninformation is disclosed. The final rule also extends information collection requirements to\nonline platforms, which includes mobile applications.\nBased on comments that the hours used to account for the initial information disclosures\nin the NPRM was too low and comments that the rule’s impact on maintenance and other\nongoing costs is measurable (recognizing, however, that regulated entities have already been\noperating and maintaining their own online platforms prior to implementation of this rule), the\nDepartment increased the number of hours per entity that DOT estimated for programming, data\nmanagement, website modification, and other related costs from 80 to 120 and also added\nadditional burden hours for ongoing maintenance of online platforms. The Department also\nupdated the applicable hourly wage from $45.90 to $53.27. The updated hourly wage was\ncalculated using an hourly rate of $53.27 for computer programmers, which is based on a median\nwage of $40.02 for web and digital interface designers from the BLS Occupational Employment\nand Wage Statistics from May 2022, multiplied by 1.41 to account for employee benefits and\nother costs to employers.\nThe Department has also updated the number of ticket agents to whom this rule would\napply using data from the US Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census based on NAICS Code\n561501 Travel Agencies.\nThe Department also accepts commenters’ arguments that the rule imposes a measurable\nburden on offline transactions and has added this additional burden to its estimates.\nThe Department has not added costs of negotiating new data-sharing agreements between\nticket agents and carriers because contract negotiations are a cost that carriers and ticket agents\nincur to do business and are not a paperwork burden for purposes of the PRA.\nThe Department has consolidated all the information collections involving the disclosure\nof critical ancillary fees and policies into one information collection (i.e., the 24-hour\ncancellation and hold policy disclosure is included in the information collection for change and\ncancellation fee and bag fee disclosures). Consolidating the information collections better\nreflects the burden of respondents to implement the changes to their online platforms to\nimplement this rule’s disclosure requirements. At the same time, the Department is separately\nestimating the burden for offline disclosures of bag, change, and cancellation fees, as the labor\ntype involved is substantially different from other disclosures in this rule.\nThis rule requires three information collections: (1) U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers,\nand ticket agents must disclose, during the online booking process, applicable fee and policy\ninformation for the first and second checked baggage and for carry-on baggage, and applicable\nfee and policy information for changing and cancelling reservations (including 24-hour\ncancellation or reservation hold policy); (2) U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket\nagents in offline transactions must disclose that bag, change, or cancellation fees apply to a\nquoted itinerary and disclose such fees upon request, and (3) U.S. air carriers and foreign air\ncarriers must ensure that entities to which they provide fare, schedule, and availability\ninformation that display or sell the carrier’s flights directly to consumers receive information\nregarding baggage fee rules and policies as well as ticket change and cancellation fees and\npolicies, if the entities are required to disclose this information to consumers.\nFor each of the information collections, the title, a description of the respondents, and an\nestimate of the burdens are set forth below:\n1. Requirement that U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose,\nduring the online booking process, the applicable fee and policy information for the\nfirst and second checked baggage, one carry-on bag, and the applicable fee and\npolicy information for changing and canceling reservation (including 24-hour\ncancellation or reservation hold policy).\nTitle: Disclosure of Ancillary Fees and Policies During the Air Transportation Booking Process\nRespondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or display carrier fare\nand schedule information to consumers in the United States.\nNumber of Respondents: We estimate that as many as 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air\ncarriers and as many as 7,497 ticket agents may be impacted by this requirement. Our estimate is\nbased on the following information and assumptions: Ticket agents includes OTAs, brick-and-\nmortar travel agencies, and tour operators that market airline tickets. We updated our number of\nticket agents based on data from NAICS code 561510 (Source: US Census Bureau, 2017\nEconomic Census), although not all of those entities market air transportation online to\nconsumers in the United States. In addition, most ticket agents rely on GDSs to create online fare\nand schedule displays. GDSs and entities that create or develop and maintain their own online\nfare and schedule displays, such as many of the impacted carriers and the largest travel agents,\nwill incur some planning, development, and programming costs to reprogram their systems to\nprovide online displays of fare and schedule information that includes baggage fee information\non their websites. Thus, our estimate of the number of impacted ticket agents may be\noverstated.124 Many smaller carriers also rely on GDSs to create online fare and schedule\ndisplays, so our estimate of 206 impacted carriers may be overstated.\nEstimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 133 hours per respondent (120 hours\nof initial display updates and 13 hours for ongoing maintenance). We base our estimate on the\nfollowing information and assumptions: the primary costs to respondents for the disclosure\nrequirement would arise from programming, data management, website modification, and other\nrelated costs to carriers and ticket agents to display the required ancillary fee information. The\nDepartment has modified the estimated annual burden on respondents to account for the\nfollowing: extension of this rule to online platforms, which have increased in usage; an\nincremental increase in one time and ongoing costs to maintain online platforms; inclusion of 24-\nhour cancellation and hold policy disclosures in this information collection;125 and a reduction in\nburden from removal of the proposed requirement for family seating fee disclosures.126\nThe more significant burdens in this rulemaking are expected to be incurred one time by\nregulated entities. Once the modifications required by this information collection have been\nincorporated into the online platforms of regulated entities, we expect that this information\ncollection will impose smaller additional ongoing costs, such as website maintenance, beyond\nwhat regulated entities were already incurring for operating online platforms prior to the\npromulgation of this rulemaking. In response to the comments received on this point, however,\nthe Department estimates that this information collection adds approximately 13 hours of burden\n124 In the NPRM, we assumed for the PRA analysis that about five percent of United States ticket agents, including\nGDSs and large travel agencies would be impacted by this requirement. In the Department’s FRIA developed in\nsupport of this final rule, however, the cost estimates for ticket agents included the total number of ticket agents who\nmay incur costs, or 7,497. Therefore, we do not include the five percent assumption in our PRA analysis for the final\nrule and instead assume all ticket agents are impacted. This is consistent with the approach taken for airlines, even\nthough smaller airlines may also use GDSs.\n125 The NPRM estimated an average annual burden of 80 hours per respondent for the design, programming, and\nmodification of websites to provide disclosure of 24-hour cancellation or hold information. The Department believes\nthis number was an overestimate due to the static nature of this disclosure (i.e., the disclosure should not have\nnoticeable variation due to the relatively stagnant nature of 24-hour cancellation or hold policies). Such policies also\nexist generally unchanged in carrier customer service plans. The burden is also reduced as this final rule does not\nrequire this disclosure if the ticket is purchased within 7 days of the flight.\n126 The Department acknowledges USTOA’s comment that the burdens of this rulemaking are not analogous to\nthose in the full fare rule (76 FR 23110). The Department has taken this comment into account in increasing the\npaperwork burdens in this analysis, including the considerations noted above.\nper respondent to maintain online platform systems. This rulemaking does not require the\ncreation of new websites or online platforms by regulated entities that did not already maintain\nsuch online platforms for the purpose of selling air transportation.\nEstimated Total Annual Burden: Approximately 1,024,499 hours for all respondents (based on\nan assumption of 27,398 hours for carriers (24,720 hours for the initial upgrade and 2,678 hours\nfor ongoing costs) and 997,101 hours for ticket agents (899,640 hours for the initial upgrade and\n97,461 hours for ongoing maintenance costs)). Based on an estimated median hourly wage of\n$53.27 for web and digital interface designers,127 this results in a total annual cost of\n$49,240,657 ($1,316,834 for carriers and $47,923,823 for ticket agents) for the first year. Note\nthat after the initial costs are incurred, the annual cost will decrease to an estimated $142,657 per\nyear for carriers and $5,191,747 per year for ticket agents.\nFrequency: One time incorporation of information into online platform displays and ongoing\ncosts (such as for maintenance). Costs are annual.\n2. U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents in offline transactions must\ndisclose that bag, change, or cancellation fees apply to a quoted itinerary and\ndisclose such fees upon request.\nTitle: Disclosure of Ancillary Fees During the Offline Booking Process\nRespondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or market tickets to\nU.S. consumers by phone or in-person\nNumber of Respondents: We estimate that as many as 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air\ncarriers and as many as 7,497 ticket agents may be impacted by this requirement. We base our\nestimate on the following information and assumptions: Ticket agents includes OTAs, brick-and-\nmortar travel agencies, and tour operators that market airline tickets. There may be an estimated\n127 The median base wage for web and digital interface developers in 2022 was $37.78,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151254.htm. We multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf.\n7,497 travel agencies in the United States, based on data from NAICS code 561510 (Source: US\nCensus Bureau, 2017 Economic Census), although not all of those entities market air\ntransportation by phone or in-person to U.S. consumers. Many carriers and ticket agents may not\noffer sales to U.S. consumers by phone or in-person; therefore, our estimate of 7,497 impacted\nticket agents and 206 impacted carriers may be overstated.\nEstimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 4 hours per respondent. This\ninformation collection adds additional disclosures to in-person or phone transactions when a\nticket is marketed to U.S. consumers. The time required to provide the additional disclosure is\nnot expected to be significant, and some consumers may not request additional disclosures.\nThe rule would require entities selling tickets marketed to U.S. consumers by phone or\nin-person to inform consumers about certain ancillary service fees at the time a fare is quoted.\nThe Department estimates that respondents will incur 4.3 additional hours of burden on average\nannually on providing the offline disclosures required by this rule.\nEstimated Total Annual Burden: Approximately 33,123 hours for all respondents (based on an\nassumption of 886 hours for carriers and 32,237 hours for ticket agents). Based on an estimated\nmedian hourly wage of $31.46 for travel agents,128 this results in a total annual cost of\n$1,042,050 ($27,874 for carriers and $1,014,176 for ticket agents). The PRA estimate developed\nhere supports a determination that the additional “talk time” for carriers is de minimis.\nFrequency: This information collection imposes an additional cost for carriers and ticket agents\nfor each interaction between a consumer and the carrier or ticket agent’s in-person or telephone\nreservation agents. Costs are annual.\n3. Requirement that U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers ensure that entities to\nwhich they provide fare, schedule, and availability information to display or sell the\ncarrier’s flights directly to consumers receive information regarding baggage fee\n128 The median base wage for travel agents in 2022 was $22.31, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes413041.htm.\nWe multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf.\nrules and ticket change and cancellation fees and policies, if the entities are required\nto disclose this information to consumers.\nTitle: Disclosure of critical ancillary fee information to other entities required to disclose fee\ninformation to consumers.\nRespondents: U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers that provide fare, schedule, and availability\ninformation to ticket agents to sell or display flights within, to, or from the United States.\nNumber of Respondents: We estimate that approximately 206 carriers will be impacted by this\nrequirement. This includes foreign carriers that may not serve the United States on their own\nequipment but may sell connecting itineraries between the United States and a foreign point,\nwhen at least one of the foreign-to-foreign segments is operated by the foreign carrier.\nEstimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 30 hours per respondent. The\ninformation collection requires carriers to either distribute baggage and change and cancellation\nfee rules or make the specific rules, including the calculation of baggage and change and\ncancellation fees applicable for passenger-specific itineraries, available to third parties. Carriers\nselling tickets in the United States already display baggage and ancillary fee information on their\nwebsites, as required by existing regulation (14 CFR 399.85(d)). This information includes the\nuse of baggage fee calculators and other tables accessible to consumers. The rulemaking requires\nthat this information be made available in such a way that other entities to which they provide\nfare, schedule, and availability information to display or sell the carrier’s flights directly to\nconsumers have access to this information in a non-static, dynamic format such that the entities\ncan disclose baggage fee and change and cancellation fee information to consumers during each\nitinerary search. The Department adjusted its number of burden hours per respondent based on\ncomments suggesting that the cost of data sharing with ticket agents is higher than the\nDepartment initially estimated. Several carriers, however, already share this information with\nother entities by agreement, which suggests that the added cost of implementing any\nmodifications required by this rule may be limited for many carriers. This potential burden of 30\nhours per respondent, as referenced here, may overestimate the actual burden for most carriers.\nEstimated Total Annual Burden: This information collection would result in an estimated annual\nburden of 6,180 hours. Based on an estimated mean hourly wage of $66.30 for computer\nprogrammers,129 this results in a total cost of approximately $409,734.\nFrequency: This information collection imposes an additional cost for carriers to provide\ninformation on critical ancillary fees to ticket agents required to disclose this information to\nconsumers. Costs are annual.\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act\nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1501, requires agencies\nto prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules\nthat include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditures by States, local, or Tribal\ngovernments, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation\nwith base year of 1995) in any one year. The 2023 threshold after adjustment for inflation is\n$198 million, using the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. The assessment\nmay be included in conjunction with other assessments, and the Department has provided the\nassessment required by UMRA within the RIA prepared in support of the final rule.\nNational Environmental Policy Act\nThe Department has analyzed the environmental impacts of this action pursuant to the\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and has determined\nthat it is categorically excluded pursuant to DOT Order 5610.1C, Procedures for Considering\nEnvironmental Impacts (44 FR 56420, Oct. 1, 1979). Categorical exclusions are actions\nidentified in an agency’s NEPA implementing procedures that do not normally have a significant\nimpact on the environment and therefore do not require either an environmental assessment (EA)\n129 The median base wage for computer programmers in 2022 was $47.02,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151251.htm. We multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf.\nor environmental impact statement (EIS).130 In analyzing the applicability of a categorical\nexclusion, the agency must also consider whether extraordinary circumstances are present that\nwould warrant the preparation of an EA or EIS.131 Paragraph 4(c)(6)(i) of DOT Order 5610.1C\nprovides that “actions relating to consumer protection, including regulations” are categorically\nexcluded. The purpose of this rulemaking is to enhance protections for air travelers and to\nimprove the air travel experience. The Department does not anticipate any environmental\nimpacts, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present in connection with this\nrulemaking.\nCongressional Review Act\nPursuant to subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of\n1996 (the Congressional Review Act), OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has\nfound that this rule falls within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 804(2).\nList of Subjects\n14 CFR Part 259\nAir carriers and foreign air carriers, Consumer protection, Reporting and recordkeeping\nrequirements.\n14 CFR Part 399\nAdministrative practice and procedure, Air carriers and foreign air carriers, Air rates and\nfares, Air taxis, Consumer protection, Law enforcement, Small businesses.\n__________________________\nPeter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg,\nSecretary of Transportation.\n130 See 40 CFR 1508.4.\n131 Id.\nFor the reasons stated in the preamble, DOT amends 14 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and F, as\nfollows:\nPART 259 – ENHANCED PROTECTIONS FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS\n1.

The authority citation for part 399 continues to read as follows:\nAuthority: 49 U.S.C. 40113(a), 41712, 46106, and 46107.\n4. Amend § 399.80 by revising the introductory text, adding paragraph (o), and revising\nparagraph (s) to read as follows:\n§ 399.80 Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.\nIt is the policy of the Department to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair\nmethod of competition the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (o) of this section by a\nticket agent of any size and the practice enumerated in paragraph (s) of this section by a ticket\nagent that sells air transportation online and is not considered a small business under the Small\nBusiness Administration’s size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201:\n* * * * *\n(o) Failing to disclose ancillary service fee information as required by § 399.85.\n* * * * *\n(s) Failing to disclose and offer web-based discount fares to prospective passengers who\ncontact the agent through other channels (e.g., by telephone or in the agent’s place of business)\nand indicate they are unable to use the agent’s website due to a disability.\n5. Amend § 399.84 by revising paragraph (a) and adding paragraphs (d) and (e) to read as\nfollows:\n§ 399.84 Price advertising and opt-out provisions.\n(a) The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier,\nindirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour\n(i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour\ncomponent (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price\nfor such air transportation, tour, or tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in\nviolation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price (all mandatory charges) to\nbe paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour\ncomponent. Mandatory charges refer to all taxes and fees that are required to purchase air\ntransportation on the channel where the advertising or solicitation occurs (e.g., if a fare is\nadvertised online for $100 then that means the fare must be available for the consumer to\npurchase for $100 online). Mandatory charges included within the single total price listed may be\nstated separately or through links or “pop ups” on online platforms that display the total price,\nbut such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed prominently, may not be\npresented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per\npassenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the mandatory charge.\n* * * * *\n(d) A carrier or ticket agent may display a price that includes all mandatory charges and\none or more ancillary service fees (i.e., fees charged for any optional service related to air travel\nbeyond passenger air transportation) in place of or more prominently than a price that only\nincludes all mandatory charges.\n(e) The Department considers any offer of a percentage-off discount for passenger air\ntransportation or for a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise\naccommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air\ntransportation, that does not make clear at the outset the terms and conditions of the offer,\nincluding how the discount is calculated, to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49\nU.S.C. 41712. When used in any advertising or solicitation, the term “base fare” must refer to an\namount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed charges and the terms “flight,” “ticket,” or\n“fare” must refer to an amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed and government\ncharges.\n6. Revise § 399.85 to read as follows:\n§ 399.85 Notice of ancillary service fees.\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\nAir transportation means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the\ntransportation of mail by aircraft as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) and (25).\nAncillary service fee means the fee charged for any optional service related to air travel\nthat a U.S. or foreign air carrier provides beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees may\ninclude, but are not limited to, fees for checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection,\naccess to in-flight entertainment programs, in-flight beverages, lounge access, snacks and meals,\npillows and blankets, and seat upgrades.\nAncillary service package means a package or bundle of one or more ancillary services\noffered for sale by a carrier or ticket agent.\nAnonymous itinerary search means a search that does not take into account information\nspecific to the passenger but does take into account information specific to the itinerary (e.g.,\ngeography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary\nservice fees to be charged or policies to be applied.\nBreak in journey means a deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a\npoint in the United States and a point in a foreign country where a stopover at a foreign point is\nscheduled. The factors to consider to determine whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption\ninclude whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign\npoint and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary,\nwhether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no\ncodeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from\nthe United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up\nchecked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount\nof time.\nClear and conspicuous means that a disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily noticeable),\neasily understandable by consumers, and presented in a manner that allows consumers to\ndetermine the true cost and enable them to select the best flight options for them.\nCritical ancillary service means any ancillary service critical to consumers’ purchasing\ndecisions. Such services are: transporting the first checked bag, the second checked bag, or a\ncarry-on bag, the ability for a consumer to cancel or change a reservation, and any other services\ndetermined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.\nConsumer or user refers to a person who seeks to obtain information about or purchase\nair transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent, whether through an\nonline platform or other means (e.g., over the telephone, in person).\nCorporate travel agent refers to a ticket agent engaged in providing travel services to the\nemployees of a business entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business\ntravel of its employees.\nOnline platform refers to any interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to,\nwebsites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air\ntransportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent.\nPassenger-specific itinerary search means a search that takes into account information\nspecific to the passenger (e.g., the passenger’s status in the airline’s frequent flyer program, the\npassenger’s military status, or the passenger’s status as a holder of a particular credit card) that\nwas affirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the itinerary (e.g.,\ngeography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary\nservice fees to be charged or policies to be applied.\n(b) Passenger-specific and anonymous itinerary searches. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign\nair carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that advertises or sells air\ntransportation marketed to U.S. consumers must offer consumers both the option to conduct a\npassenger-specific itinerary search and the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search.\n(c) Online disclosures of ancillary service fees--(1) Critical ancillary service fees. Each\nU.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an\nonline platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must\nclearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform the accurate fee that applies, if any, for\nall critical ancillary services. The fee cannot be designated as $0 in circumstances where a\ncritical ancillary service is not available to the consumer but rather must state “not available” or a\nsimilar notation. The fee information must be provided the first time that fare and schedule\ninformation is disclosed after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an\nanonymous itinerary search. The fees cannot be displayed through a hyperlink.\n(2) Other ancillary service fees. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent\n(except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it\nadvertises or sells air transportation may disclose ancillary service fees that are not critical\nancillary service fees at the same time as critical ancillary service fees.\n(3) Ancillary service packages. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent\n(except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it\nadvertises or sells air transportation must disclose the standalone fee for each critical ancillary\nservice required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section when fare and schedule information is\nprovided. Nothing in this section requires or prohibits a carrier or ticket agent from disclosing an\nancillary service package that includes critical ancillary services if it chooses to do so.\n(4) Air tour packages. Each ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S.\nconsumers where it advertises or sells air tour packages must clearly and conspicuously disclose,\nat the time the ticket agent offers a package fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a\nconsumer, where the carrier providing air transportation is not known, that additional fees for\nbaggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger’s\nfrequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. When the carrier\nproviding air transportation for an air-tour package is known, that ticket agent must provide\nbaggage fee information as prescribed by this paragraph (c) at the time that the ticket agent\ndiscloses the name of the carrier to the consumer.\n(5) Website disclosure of all ancillary service fees. A U.S. or foreign air carrier that has a\nwebsite marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly\nand conspicuously disclose on its website accurate information on ancillary service fees available\nto a passenger purchasing air transportation with a clear and conspicuous link from the carrier’s\nhomepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such ancillary services and related\nfees are disclosed. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however,\nbaggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (e.g., frequent\nflyer status, early purchase) that affect those charges.\n(d) Online disclosure of baggage policies. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and\nticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S.\nconsumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose\non its online platform, before ticket purchase, the accurate weight and dimension limitations that\nthe carrier imposes for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag after a consumer\nconducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search.\n(e) Intent to travel with a bag. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent\nthat has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air\ntransportation may clearly and conspicuously solicit information from a consumer prior to the\nconsumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search for air\ntransportation regarding the consumer’s intention to travel with a carry-on bag, a first checked\nbag, or a second checked bag. If the consumer affirmatively takes action to indicate that the\nconsumer and all others in the booking party do not intend to travel with a carry-on bag, a first\nchecked bag, or a second checked bag, then the carrier or ticket agent may forego disclosing the\nfees for that bag with the fare and schedule information as required by paragraph (c) of this\nsection. Carriers and ticket agents (except a corporate travel agent) must disclose the baggage\npolicies before ticket purchase as required by paragraph (d) of this section and must disclose\ninformation regarding the passenger’s free baggage allowance and fee information for a carry-on\nbag, a first checked bag, and a second checked bag on e-ticket confirmations as required by\nparagraph (k) of this section even if a consumer indicates an intention not to travel with a bag.\n(f) Online disclosure of cancellation and change policies. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air\ncarrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to\nU.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must accurately, clearly, and\nconspicuously, disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the components of change\nand cancellation policies identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.\n(1) Restrictions and prohibitions. A summary of the applicable restrictions and\nprohibitions to change or cancel a ticket that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-\nspecific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search, including any prohibitions or restrictions to\nobtaining a refund of the full amount paid;\n(2) Form of refund. A summary of the applicable policy regarding the form of the refund\nfor a change or cancellation (e.g., a credit to the original form of payment, airline credits or\nvoucher) that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous\nitinerary search;\n(3) Fare differential. A summary of the applicable policy regarding a consumer’s right to,\nor responsibility for, any fare differential, including whether the consumer is entitled to a refund\nin fare difference if the consumer changes to a lower cost replacement flight, that apply to the\nconsumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search; and\n(4) 24-Hour hold or cancellation. A statement disclosed clearly and conspicuously on the\nlast page of the booking process on allowing the reservation to be held at the quoted fare without\npayment, or cancelled without penalty, for at least twenty-four hours after the reservation is\nmade, consistent with a carrier’s customer service plan in § 259.5(b)(4) of this chapter and\nconsistent with a ticket agent’s policy. A ticket agent that has a policy of not allowing a 24-hour\nhold or cancellation must disclose that information clearly and conspicuously on the last page of\nthe booking process. The disclosures in this paragraph (f)(4) are required if the reservation is\nmade one week or more prior to a flight's departure.\n(g) Disclosures on landing page. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent\n(except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it\nsells air transportation and that accepts a redirect of consumers to its online platform to complete\nthe booking must ensure that the required critical ancillary service fee information in paragraph\n(c) of this section is accurately, clearly, and conspicuously displayed on the first page of the\nonline platform to which the consumer has been directed, unless the consumer was provided\naccurate fee information of critical ancillary services on the directing entity’s online platform.\n(h) Seat guarantee notice. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a\ncorporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it\nadvertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose the following notice\non any page or step of the booking process in which a consumer is offered a seat selection for a\nfee: “A seat is included in your fare. You are not required to purchase a seat assignment to travel.\nIf you decide to purchase a ticket and do not select a seat prior to purchase, a seat will be\nprovided to you without additional charge when you travel.”\n(i) Code-share partner disclosures. For air transportation within, to or from the United\nStates, a carrier marketing a flight under its identity that is operated by a different carrier,\notherwise known as a code-share flight, must through its website disclose to consumers booked\non a code-share flight any differences between its optional services and related fees and those of\nthe carrier operating the flight. This disclosure may be made through a conspicuous notice of the\nexistence of such differences on the marketing carrier’s website or a conspicuous hyperlink\ntaking the reader directly to the operating carrier’s fee listing or to a page on the marketing\ncarrier’s website that lists the differences in policies among code-share partners.\n(j) Offline fee disclosures of ancillary services. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier,\nand ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that markets air transportation to U.S.\nconsumers in person or by phone must disclose to consumers, at the time a fare is quoted for an\nitinerary, that baggage fees (for a first checked, second checked, or carry-on bag), change fees,\nand cancellation fees apply, if that is the case. The U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent\n(other than a corporate travel agent) must then ask the consumer if they wish to hear more about\nthe specific baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and any other critical ancillary service\nfees that apply. These carriers and ticket agents, upon request from the consumer, must disclose\nthose specific fees taking into account passenger-specific information provided by the consumer.\n(k) Disclosures of baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations. A U.S. carrier, a foreign air\ncarrier, or a ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to\nU.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must include information regarding\nthe passenger’s free baggage allowance (including personal item) and the applicable fee for a\ncarry-on bag and the first and second checked bag on all e-ticket confirmations for air\ntransportation within, to or from the United States, including on the summary page at the\ncompletion of an online purchase and in a post-purchase email confirmation. Carriers and ticket\nagents must provide the fee information for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second\nchecked bag in text form in the e-ticket confirmation taking into account any passenger-specific\nfactors that affect those charges.\n(l) Sharing information on fee rules and policies. Each U.S. and foreign air carrier that\nprovides fare, schedule, and availability information for air transportation within, to, or from the\nUnited States to an entity that is required by law to disclose critical ancillary service fee and\npolicy information directly to consumers must disclose fee and policy information for critical\nancillary fee services to that entity. The information provided must be useable, current, accurate,\nand sufficient to ensure compliance by such entities.\n(m) Unfair and deceptive practice. The Department considers the failure to provide and\nadhere to the disclosures required by this section to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the\nmeaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.\n7. Amend § 399.88 by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:\n§ 399.88 Prohibition on post-purchase price increase.\n(a) It is an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 for any\nseller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, or of a tour (i.e., a\ncombination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component\n(e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States,\nto increase the ticket price of that air transportation, tour or tour component, or to raise the price\nfor critical ancillary services as defined in § 399.85(a) to a consumer after the air transportation\nhas been purchased by the consumer, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed\ntax or fee. A purchase is deemed to have occurred when the full amount agreed upon has been\npaid by the consumer.\n* * * * *",
