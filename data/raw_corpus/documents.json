Storage locations are either (i) secure areas within our Hosts\u2019 premises, typically, in separate rooms or (ii) access-code restricted lockers, which may be in a public space or located more privately at a Host\u2019s premises. Non-public storage locations typically have security measures in place such as restricted access and/or lockable units and/or CCTV surveillance.1.3 Stasher does not itself act as a Host. Under the Host , each Host authorises us to act as the Host\u2019s commercial agent to negotiate and conclude each Storage Agreement with the relevant Customer under clause 3 of these  for the supply of Storage, only on the Host\u2019s behalf. The geographical address and identity of Host will be specified in the relevant booking information (\u201cBooking\u201d) and the Storage Agreement. In this limited capacity, we are not a party to the Storage Agreement. We charge Hosts a commission for providing our services to them. We collect the Storage Fees due under the Storage Agreement on the Host\u2019s behalf as the \u2018merchant of record\u2019 that you will see on your card or payment account statement.2. Bookings and Fees Payable to Hosts2.1 Customers may book Storage via the Website or Apps at any time. Please check each Host\u2019s opening hours via the Website or Apps prior to Booking.

Each customer will also be asked to provide payment card information to a third party payment provider and each Customer\u2019s payment card will be debited at the time of Booking. Once payment is confirmed, a Customer\u2019s Booking transaction and payment is complete, and the Customer will receive an e-mail confirmation summarising his confirmed Booking. All payments by Customers to Stasher and by Stasher to Hosts will be processed through the Stripe online payment system, unless clearly stated otherwise. Payments made through Stripe will be subject to their automatic fraud checks. Please see www.stripe.com/radar for more information.2.4 Customers are reminded that Storage must be booked through the Website or Apps. Hosts are not permitted to accept cash payment in store and Customers must not attempt to pay for Storage in cash or otherwise outside the Website or Apps.2.5 The fees for each transaction are displayed in the pricing section of the Website or Apps and are stated inclusive of VAT.

Storage Agreement with the Host3.1 Our hosts and locker partners are responsible for keeping your items safe during the storage period, whether stored in person or a Stasher-approved locker. All lockers and storage partners must meet strict safety and operational standards set by Stasher, including but not limited to restriction of access when not in public areas.3.2 The Website or Apps provides the opening times of each Host, and you are responsible for checking that these suit your Booking plans. By making a Booking and paying for Storage through the Website or Apps, you enter into a contract with the Host who provides that Storage on the standard  and  displayed to you during the Booking process (and available here) which also form part of these  (\u201cStorage Agreement\u201d).

Each Host is responsible for any damage to, or loss or theft of, items stored with that Host unless the damage is caused by factors beyond the control of the Host.3.5 If a Host alters its opening hours (either generally or on a particular day) or closes due to unforeseen circumstances and this will affect an existing Booking by you, the Host must inform Stasher by  to [ protected] as a matter of urgency.

In the case that you cannot access your bags at your pickup time, Stasher will attempt to make reasonable arrangements to get your bag to you.3.6 If you fail to collect your luggage at the time stated in the Storage Agreement, the Host must inform us. We will attempt to reach you and arrange for you to collect your luggage at a new time. Failing this, we will arrange for the collection of your luggage from the Host and delivery of your luggage to you, at your expense. If we are unable to contact you, and you have not contacted us or collected your bags within 7 days of the agreed date, or you fail to pay for the delivery of the bags to you within 7 days of the agreed date for payment, we will dispose of your luggage without further responsibility or liability to you or the Host. Customers are responsible for timely retrieval of their luggage at the designated pickup time. In the case of locker usage, timely pickup is essential. Stasher retains the right to resell the locker space, even if luggage is not retrieved by the booked pickup time. Therefore, customers acknowledge that Stasher bears no liability or responsibility for luggage left in lockers beyond the designated pickup time. When your booking time elapses, your luggage will no longer be covered by our guarantee. If you are unable to retrieve your booking on time, please contact customer support at https://stasher.com/support. They will be able to either extend your booking or arrange for your belongings to be kept in safe storage until you collect them.3.7 We, Stasher, hereby state that we act as the agent for our hosts in the issuance of invoices for the services rendered.

During this period, you may contact the Hotel directly to arrange collection. If your belongings are not claimed within seven days and we have not received further instructions from you, the Premier Inn team reserves the right to dispose of them without further liability. Once your booking period expires, Stasher is not responsible for the safekeeping, condition, or retrieval of any uncollected items. We do not provide insurance coverage for items left beyond the agreed storage period. If you anticipate being late, please contact Stasher support as soon as possible. We will do our best to assist, but storage beyond your booking time is at the Premier Inn\u2019s discretion and may incur additional charges.3.9 Stasher shall not be liable for incidents arising from improper locker use, including but not limited to: failing to properly close the locker, forcing a door closed under pressure, sharing access codes, storing prohibited items, or not complying with the instructions outlined in these  and  or the booking confirmation . In particular, if the confirmation  specifies that the access and retrieval codes are valid for one-time use only, the Customer must strictly follow those instructions. Attempting to reuse such codes or forcing access after the code has expired constitutes misuse. In such cases, Stasher\u2019s customer support may assist in reactivating the access mechanism within a reasonable timeframe, but any delays, missed transportation, or additional costs incurred due to this misuse remain the sole responsibility of the Customer. Stasher is under no obligation to offer compensation for incidents resulting from failure to follow these instructions.3.10 The Stasher\u2019s Guarantee applies only to items properly stored inside a closed suitcase or bag. Stasher will not be liable for any item attached to, hanging from, or left outside the luggage.3.11 Pre-Damaged LuggageCustomers must ensure that all luggage and items presented for Storage are in good, secure, and serviceable condition at the time of drop-off.

Where such evidence is unavailable or inconsistent, Stasher reserves the right to reasonably reject claims under the Stasher Guarantee or otherwise.By depositing luggage, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that Stasher and the Host are not responsible for any damage to items that were already compromised, defective, or inadequately packed before storage.4.

Livechat &  support is available everyday. How did it all start? My Baggage was founded by Paul Stewart in 2009 after having issues moving his personal effects between Belfast and Edinburgh, where he was studying engineering. My Baggage was previously called Uni Baggage, as the service was primarily used by students in the UK, it rebranded in 2019 to My Baggage as its customer base expanded beyond students and into additional international routes. When Paul was studying in 2009 and moving to and from Edinburgh, he was getting charged large excess baggage fees every time he had to fly home 3-4 times a year, it was too slow and expensive to drive and get the ferry between the two cities. So Paul thought there had to be another way to transport his stuff. His personal effects didn't necessarily need to travel with him, he could ship them instead. Unfortunately, at the time shipping personal effects was difficult, slow and expensive, there were not many options available to the general public, you had to set up accounts, credit checks, fuel surcharges and lots of paperwork. After all the hassle of doing this Paul thought he could offer a better service to people that needed to send personal effects and so My Baggage was born. Initially focused at students in the UK, users could see a fixed price for sending luggage and book online in a few simple steps and pay online. Then a driver would come and collect your luggage and boxes from your door and deliver them within 2 days, all tracked online. My Baggage has since expanded from 3 routes in the UK to 40,000 international routes all bookable online with clear prices and simple booking process, helping tens of thousands of customer move their personal effects all over the world. What our customers sayWe ask our customers to review us and if possible leave a video review of their experience Trustpilot View all reviews We try to do our bit We donate a percentage of all our profits to good causes. Over that past 4 years, My Baggage has donated to L'Arche, Shelter, Down's Syndrome Association, Cash For Kids and Comic Relief. If there is a charity you are passionate about please get in touch.

These need to be within the Alaska Airlines baggage allowance 2025\u200b limits of the aircraft\u2019s authorized storage area. If the wheelchair cannot be safely stowed in the approved storage closet, then the airline will transport it to the cargo compartment at no extra charge. Spillable Batteries: According to federal HAZMAT safety requirements, the battery must be taken out when a mobility assistance is powered by a spillable battery. It must be out in a protected battery box. Non-Spillable Batteries: According to the Alaska Airline carry on baggage allowance\u200b\u200b , one \u201cspare\u201d non-spillable battery is allowed per guest.

Download Our App Today To Ensure Stress Free Travel Emirates Checked Baggage Emirates bills itself as having \u201cone of the most generous baggage allowances in the world.\u201d The airline\u2019s checked luggage allotments are based on a calculation that considers origin, destination, cabin class, and ticket fare. Depending on your route, Emirates may use either a weight model or a per-piece model. Spending time in Dubai? Try our luggage storage options in the UAE. Emirates Checked Baggage Allowance: Per-Piece Model The table below outlines Emirates\u2019 checked baggage allowance for flights to the Americas from Africa, Asia, Australia / New Zealand, and the Middle East, in addition to all routes taking off in Africa and heading to the Americas, Asia, Australia / New Zealand, or the Middle East.

If your route starts in Africa, and you bought an Economy Special ticket before May 11, 2020, you can check two pieces of luggage that weigh up to 23 kg each. If your journey begins in the Americas, Asia, Australia, or New Zealand and includes a stopover in Dubai that\u2019s 24-hours-long or more, the weight baggage model applies, not the per-piece one. Members of Emirates\u2019 frequent flyer programs may enjoy a higher baggage allowance in some circumstances. Call to find out. Emirates Checked Baggage Allowance: Weight Model All other Emirates flights not outlined above in the per-piece baggage allowance model use a weight system. Instead of limiting passengers to the number of items they can check, limits are based solely on weight. Class and FareChecked Baggage AllowanceWeight Limit (Each Baggage Item)Size Limit (Each Baggage Item)Economy Specialunlimited20 kg (44 lbs)300 cm (118 in)Economy Saverunlimited25 kg (55.1 lbs)300 cm (118 in)Economy Flexunlimited30 kg (66.1 lbs)300 cm (118 in)Economy Flex Plusunlimited35 kg (77.1 lbs)300 cm (118 in)Businessunlimited40 kg (88.1 lbs)300 cm (118 in)Firstunlimited50 kg (110.2 lbs)300 cm (118 in) For example, let\u2019s say you have a business-class ticket from Amsterdam to Durban, you could check 10 bags whose combined weight didn\u2019t exceed 40 kg (88.1 lbs). Emirates Weight Checked Baggage Anomalies People with Economy Special tickets between UAE and India enjoy a 25 kg limit. People departing from Australia or New Zealand with an Economy Saver ticket bought on or after November 26, 2019, enjoy a 30 kg limit. Members of Emirates frequent flyer programs may enjoy a higher baggage allowance in some circumstances. Call to inquire. Emirates Checked Baggage Exceptions Passengers with crutches or braces may check them free of charge. Passengers transporting a dialysis machine can check it free of charge. Assistance dogs may be checked in the hold but are not allowed in the cabin. Explore our global luggage storage options. Emirates Excess Baggage Policies Emirates ticket holders can pay to increase their baggage allowances. Note that any luggage item exceeding 300 cm (118 in) cannot be checked on any Emirates commercial flight. It must be sent by Emirates freight or shipped by a third party. Emirates Excess Baggage Policy: Weight Model If you\u2019re on a flight using the Emirates weight model baggage allowance, you can buy additional kilos, in five-kilo blocks, up to a maximum of 25. Purchasing the extra baggage space online \u2014 up to four hours before departure \u2014 will save you money; the first 5 kg add-on pack is 50 percent cheaper online than the check-in-desk price, and 20 percent less for each subsequent add-on weight pack. Here\u2019s a table of Emirates additional baggage fees based on the route. Note that the airline uses the United States dollar as its standard legal tender. If you\u2019re paying in another currency, the transaction day exchange rate applies. To / FromMiddle East / South AsiaAfricaFar EastEuropeAustralia and New ZealandMiddle East / South Asia$20$30$30$30$30Far East$30$40$15$40$30Europe$30$40$40$15$50Australia and New Zealand$40$50$30$50$15 So let\u2019s say you have a business-class ticket from London to Madrid and have 65-kg-worth of luggage. The first 40 kg is included in the price of your fare. The next 5 kg would cost $7.50 if you bought it online, or $15 at the airport. The additional four 5-kg packs needed to reach 65 would cost $12 each if purchased ahead of time and $15 each at the check-in desk. Ultimately, your additional baggage fees (for flights using the weight model) would be $55.50 if purchased at least 4 hours before the flight and $75 if bought at the airport. Emirates Excess Baggage Policy: Per-Piece Model If you\u2019re on a flight using Emirates\u2019 per-piece luggage model, you can pay to bring more bags. The maximum number of checked items per ticket holder is 10, which includes allowances associated with your fare and cabin. Purchasing additional luggage space online, up to four hours before departure, saves you money. However, you can only buy a max of three overage items online; the remaining bags are always charged the full rate. Emirates\u2019 full excess baggage fee, under its per-piece model, is $200 per bag. The online price is 50 percent off the first piece of extra luggage and 20 percent off the other two, but only for those in the Economy class. Everyone else must pay the full fee for every piece of extra luggage. From / ToAfricaAmericasAsiaAustralia and New ZealandEuropeMiddle EastAfrica$200$200$200$200$200$200Americas$200$200$200$200$200$200 Skywards Members Extra Allowance Silver, Gold, and Platinum members receive additional checked baggage allowances when traveling to select destinations. Emirates Excess Baggage Fees: Weight Model Emirates charges for oversized and overweight luggage when using the weight model. It\u2019s $75 per overweight parcel for flights originating in Africa or to/from the Americas, $250 if oversized, and $350 if oversized and overweight. If you buy additional luggage allowances for the same routes, the fees jump to $275 (overweight), $325 (oversized), and $400 (overweight and oversized) per item! (Pro tip: If your excess luggage fee costs climb into the hundreds, it\u2019s almost always cheaper to ship the items through a third-party international shipper, like Stasher.) Emirates Sports Equipment Baggage Policy Most sports equipment can be checked on Emirates flights. However, anything larger than 300 cm (118 in) must be sent by Emirates freight or a third-party luggage shipper.

Prices range from \u00a336 \u2013 \u00a3120 per bag if you book online, and \u00a340 \u2013 \u00a3140 if you want to book at the airport. Use The Stasher App For Convenient Luggage Storage Wherever You Are \u2013 Download Now British Airways Excess Baggage Policy Bags larger than the standard size but within the maximum dimensions of 190 x 75 x 65 cm are accepted as oversize baggage and may incur additional fees. If your bag is heavier than 32kg it will be shipped as cargo. Please contact the airline directly for more information about this. British Airways Sports Equipment The British Airways policy for sports equipment is very straightforward. If your equipment is within the checked luggage size and weight allowances then you can take it as normal \u2013 you may need to book extra bags for this. If they are heavier or larger, then you can arrange to have them shipped as cargo. It is recommended to contact British Airways at least 48 hours before your flight. British Airways Musical Instruments As with sports equipment, as long as your instrument is within the British Airways size and weight allowances, you can travel with them as carry-on or checked luggage. If your instrument is larger than hand luggage but you do not wish for it to go in the hold, you may like to reserve a seat for it. You cannot book these seats online, so make sure to contact the airline at least 24 hours before you fly to check availability. Pro tip: When travelling with an instrument, make sure you pack it in a sturdy flight case to prevent it being damaged. Contact British Airways To get help with baggage enquiries, you can contact British Airways directly on 0344 493 0787 6am \u2013 11pm daily. Alternative to Excess Baggage Fees While carry-on and checked baggage is an easy option for small amounts of luggage, sometimes we find ourselves needing to transport large amounts of luggage or bulky, heavy items abroad, which can be very expensive through the airline.

Shipping your luggage with Stasher is safe, affordable, and fully insured. Luggage delivery removes the problem of weight and size restrictions, and leaves you with more travel flexibility, and less stress on the day of travel.

Send your belongings... Like our TV ads? Watch them allWatch them all How Send My Bag Works If you\u2019re travelling away, whether it\u2019s a leisure holiday hitting the slopes in Austria, studying abroad in the US, or taking an extended break in Hong Kong, it\u2019s possible that you will have excess baggage or oversized luggage that will need shipping to your destination. Here at Send My Bag, we\u2019ll get your unaccompanied luggage from point A to point B safe and sound. Here\u2019s our step-by-step guide to show how easy it is! Step 1: Get a Quick Quote Once you\u2019ve decided to use Send My Bag\u00ae for your excess baggage shipping, whether you\u2019re sending a golf bag and clubs or simply an extra heavy suitcase, you can use our hassle free quick quote tool which will give you a price for your delivery within seconds. Simply enter the country you\u2019d like it collected from, where you\u2019d like it sent to and a date and press go. We\u2019ll provide you with our best rate as well as an estimated date for delivery. Step 2: Book Your Unaccompanied Luggage Shipping Online When you\u2019re happy with the price we\u2019ve quoted you, go ahead and book your unaccompanied luggage delivery online with our super-easy booking system. All you will need to do is choose a collection day, which can be any working day of the week. We recommend booking at least 24 hours in advance for domestic shipments, 48 hours in advance for non-EU collections and 72 hours in very remote areas. It should take no more than 5 minutes to have your excess bags booked in for delivery. Step 3: Prepare Your Unaccompanied Bags Our destination pages will give you all the information on which items you can and can\u2019t transport to certain destinations, but in general, you should never pack aerosols, flammable liquids, or glass in unaccompanied bags and you should ensure that you have packed thoroughly for transit and that any cardboard boxes used are reinforced and sturdy.In the days before your collection (usually no less than 5 days in advance), a booking confirmation  will be sent to you which includes a tracking number and links where you can download your labels. You will need to print these and attach them to your bag as they are compulsory for shipping excess baggage on all our services. If you book a week or more in advance, during checkout we'll give you the option to have labels printed and sent to you. It\u2019s also recommended that you put a spare copy inside each bag, too. We recommend attaching labels using an official Send My Bag\u00ae label holder, which you can order free of charge during checkout.Bags outside the EU will need customs clearance information. You will receive this information by , including forms for you to complete. These will also need to be printed and attached in a separate wallet.Watch our preparing your bag video.Sending sports equipment? Check out our information pages on sending bikes, skis, and golf clubs. Step 4: Collection of Your Excess Baggage Send My Bag\u00ae collections usually take place between 9am and 6pm, but we cannot guarantee a specific time. Nor can we telephone you when the driver has arrived. The sender is not required to hand the luggage over to the driver, so we\u2019re happy for you to leave it with a neighbour and let us know, or to take it to your place of work if you won\u2019t be in at your residential address. Bear in mind that items will need to be collected at the main point of access, so they will need to be brought to the ground floor, to a reception, or a porter\u2019s office if you are in student halls. Step 5: Track Your Unaccompanied Bags Log into your account and simply select your delivery to follow its journey. It is possible to track it through both our local and international couriers. Step 6: Delivery Send My Bag\u00ae has an excellent rate of correct delivery estimations, with more than 95% of standard deliveries and 99.5% of express deliveries of unaccompanied luggage arriving on time. However, we recommend allowing a little extra time in case of any unexpected disruptions.If you're sending within Europe on an Express Service, you're covered by our on time guarantee.As with collection, the named recipient or sender does not need to sign for the item; it can be anyone at the delivery address. For example, a concierge or the reception desk at your hotel may receive it for you, but please ensure that you have notified them of the delivery in advance.

Check out our full Advertising Disclosure. Just like with most airlines, the days of getting free baggage when flying United Airlines are long, long gone. In fact, it'll cost you more than ever. Along with every other major U.S. airline, United raised fees to check luggage in early 2024 \u2013 the first hike in years. From the fees you'll pay to the baggage allowance and everything in between, United baggage fees vary wildly based on where you're going, what kind of ticket you have, your airline status, or what credit cards are in your wallet. You can even save a few bucks by pre-paying for your suitcase online. But you're reading this because you want to avoid paying altogether, right? Lucky you: There are a handful of tips and tricks that can save you big bucks on your bags on your next United flight. United's Current Baggage Fees Exactly what you get free or what baggage charges you'll pay depends on where you're going \u2013 and what kind of ticket you buy. The first checked bag will cost you $35 for most domestic flights. Heading overseas, it might be free \u2026 but could also cost you $75 each way. And if you need to check more than one bag, that can jump to as much as $200. Ouch. Thrifty Tip: By pre-paying for your bags on United's website more than 24 hours before your flight, you get $5 off on flights within the U.S., to Canada, Mexico, and throughout the Caribbean. Fortunately, United offers a handy baggage fee calculator on its website. Whether you've already a United flights booked or are just planning, you can use the baggage calculator to find out what United fees you'll have to pay. For example, here's what the baggage calculator will show you for a standard domestic flight. The biggest difference-maker is what kind of ticket you bought. Your final bill for baggage will vary depending on your fare class: Did you buy the cheapest United basic economy fare? Or are you flying United Polaris business class? We've broken down the cost of United's checked bag fees below. One note: All the prices here factor in the $5 discount for paying ahead of time. If you wait until day of, you may have to pay another $5. And these prices are one-way, so double them for a round-trip ticket. Fees for United Basic Economy Buying United's cheapest basic economy tickets means you may have to pay much more for your bags. DestinationFirst bagSecond bagAdditional bags U.S. $35$45$150 Mexico$35$45$150 Canada$40$50$150 Caribbean & Central America$35$45$200 El Salvador$35$100$200 Panama $35$45$200 South America$70$100$150 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru$70$100$200 Europe$75$100$200 Middle East & AfricaFreeFree$200 India$75$200$300 AsiaFree$100$200 Australia & OceaniaFree$100$200 Fees for United Economy Even with a pricier, standard economy ticket, you might pay the same bag fee But your first checked bag to Europe, Asia, and much of South America is free. In some cases, you get a second bag free, too. DestinationFirst bagSecond bagAdditional bags U.S.$35$45$150 Mexico$35$45$150 Canada$35$45$150 Caribbean & Central America$35$100$200 El Salvador Free$100$200 PanamaFree$45$200 South AmericaFree$100$200 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, PeruFree$100$200 EuropeFree$100$200 Middle East & AfricaFreeFree$200 IndiaFree$200$300 AsiaFreeFree$200 Australia & OceaniaFree$100$200 Fees in Premium Plus, Business Class & First Class All Premium Economy fares and above can check their first two bags for free. All additional and oversized baggage fees are identical to economy tickets. United's (Terrible) Carry-On Policy What really separates United from its domestic rivals like Delta, American, and Alaska is its carry-on baggage allowance. Travelers who book basic economy fares on United are only allowed to bring a personal item on board \u2013 you cannot bring a carry-on bag. You read that right: There's no carry-on bag allowance with United's cheapest fares. You can only bring a backpack, purse, or personal item. United recently relaxed one of the worst aspects of this policy: You can now check in online with a basic economy ticket. But you'll have to pre-authorize a $65 charge to a credit card on file \u2013 $40 in case you decide to bring a bag, plus another $25 for a gate handling fee fee. It's one of the most restrictive policies you'll find among basic economy fares on U.S. airlines and the reason United was the clear loser in our Battle of Basic Economy. That said, there are some exceptions and workarounds: Basic economy fares to Canada or South America. Transatlantic and transpacific basic economy tickets. Having a co-branded credit card like the *united explorer*. Flyers with United MileagePlus elite status. Flyers with Star Alliance Gold status or higher. Oversized Bags, Strollers, Sports Equipment & More Overweight and Oversized Bag Fees If you have bulky, overweight baggage or oversized bags on United, you could be on the hook for hundreds of extra dollars. For starters, all baggage flying with United must be no more than 62 linear inches (or 157 centimeters). Just combine the width, height, and length of your bag to measure. Any bags from 63 linear inches to 115 inches will incur an oversize baggage fee of $200 apiece. And bags larger than 115 linear inches aren't allowed, period. For overweight bags, the limit is 50 pounds \u2013 for most flyers, anyway. How much you'll pay depends on how heavy your bag is: 51 to 70 pounds can get charged an extra $100 to as much as $300 per bag. 71 to 100 pounds will get charged an additional $200 or up to $400 per bag. Checked bags heavier than 100 pounds aren't allowed. You get a bit more leeway with United baggage weight limits if you've got status or are flying business or first class: Bags can weigh up to 70 pounds. Anything heavier and you'll pay United's standard overweight fees. Other Luggage: Strollers, Pets, Sporting Equipment Car seats and strollers: United accepts one free car seat free of charge for each child, in addition to a stroller or folding wagon. Wheelchairs: Wheelchairs and other assistive devices are free on all United flights, so long as the devices can fit into the aircraft bin door. Pets: In-cabin pets in carriers underneath the seat in front of you cost $150 each way and include a $150 upcharge for layovers over four hours in the U.S. or 24 hours outside of the U.S. United no longer allows passengers to check larger pets to their final destination. Skis and Snowboard Equipment: Passengers are allowed up to two snowboards or skis that count as a regular bag, so long as they adhere to weight and size restrictions \u2013 and you're in luck as almost all ski bags do. One big thing for skiers to keep in mind: When checking skis or snowboards, travelers are also allowed to check a ski boot bag at no additional cost, so long as both bags are under 50 pounds. Bicycles: United allows charges cyclists to fly with bicycles as checked baggage if packed appropriately in a hard-sided case or durable cardboard box. Oversized bag fees don't apply to checked bicycles, but they are subject to standard checked baggage fees as well as any overweight baggage fees. Hockey and lacrosse equipment: Hockey and lacrosse equipment bags are charged the same as regular baggage, but they include two hockey or lacrosse sticks along with the bag at no additional cost. For other sports equipment (including scuba diving, hang gliding, windsurfing, and paintball), visit United's website. How to Save on (Or Avoid) United Baggage Fees No one likes paying baggage fees. Fortunately, there are a handful of tips and tools you can employ to save flying United \u2013 or avoid paying them altogether. Thrifty Tip: All active duty or retired U.S. military personnel traveling on orders, relocations, or just personally, receive two free bags on all United flights. Pack in Just a Carry-On The first way to avoid paying baggage fees with United is completely free: You just have to pack a bit less. Unless you bought a United basic economy ticket, you can always bring a carry-on bag (plus another smaller personal item like a backpack or purse) for free. Plus, it saves you the time of checking in a bag \u2013 and the stress of the airline losing your belongings, too. Follow our tips and you\u2019ll be a proud member of Team Carry-On in no time! Book a Main Cabin Fare Abroad Need to check a bag for your big international trip? It might be well worth paying a bit more for a standard economy fare. On flights to South America, Europe, and India, United charges travelers with a basic economy ticket a whopping $70 to $75 each way for a checked bag. But a main cabin economy ticket still gets the first bag free. So on this flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Bogota (BOG), for example, adding a checked bag would cost you another $140 \u2013 for a total of $800. If you need to check bags, you'd be much better off buying the main cabin ticket for $770. It won't always work out this way, but it's worth doing the math. Hold a United Credit Card Almost any co-branded United credit card will get you a free first bag when you fly with United. There's just one small hitch: To get a free bag, you have to actually pay for your flight with your United credit card. The cheapest option is the *united explorer*, which gets you one checked bag free on any United-operated flight. What's more, you'll also get a free bag for one companion booked on your reservation. Considering bags cost at least $35 each way, you can come out ahead on the card's $150 annual fee after a few roundtrip flights. And the Explorer Card's annual fee is even waived for the first year! It gets even better with the *united quest*, which will get you and your companion two checked bags free on United and United Express-operated flights when you pay for your flights with the card. If you check a lot of luggage, the savings there can be substantial, easily outweighing its $350 annual fee. The top-tier *united club infinite* also gets you two free checked bags, but its $695 annual fee means it's not the right fit for most travelers. Fly Up Front in Premium Plus or Higher Whether you're flying in Premium Plus (United's name for Premium Economy), first class, or a United Polaris business class ticket, you get two free checked bags on every United flight. What's more, flyers with these tickets get a more generous United baggage allowance: Bags can be up to 70 pounds. Earn United or Star Alliance Status Almost any level of United or Star Alliance status will also give you free bags. But just what you get depends on how high you climb. Here's a breakdown: StatusFirst bagSecond bag United Premier SliverFree$45 United Premier Gold, Platinum, or 1KFreeFree Star Alliance GoldFree$45 United Premier Silver, Gold, Platinum, and 1K members all receive at least one free bag. That means even entry-level status holders with United get a free bag. If you're earning Star Alliance status through a partner carrier, you have to earn Star Alliance Gold to get a free bag on United. Pay for a Subscription United offers something no other major U.S. airline does: You can purchase a baggage subscription to avoid baggage fees when you fly. A United baggage subscription gives you up to two bags per flight. Subscription costs vary widely based on how many bags you want to check, how many travelers you want on your plan, and where you plan to go. It starts at $349 for a solo traveler checking a bag only within the U.S. A solo plan to check two bags on any United flight worldwide jumps to $799. For two travelers and two bags anywhere in the world, it's $899. Just note that this subscription won't cover the additional fees for oversized or overweight bags. If you travel a ton with United, this could be worth considering. Then again, all that flying may mean you get free bags anyway with United elite status.  on United's baggage subscription package. Bottom Line As with any airline, look before you book with United. These bag fees can add up fast. Exactly what you'll have to pay to check a bag with United depends on what fare you buy, where you're going, and what you've got in your wallet. And you might not even be able to bring a carry-on bag, either. Stop Overpaying for Travel! Get our daily  for the latest in travel, flight deals, and how to save on your next trip.

Reply David says: June 27, 2023 at 5:45 am I bought a ticket from Air Canada (including check-in baggage) but the flight was operated by UA. I was required to pay 31,50 CAD for the baggage. UA argued, that since the ticket wasn\u00b4t purchased at UA, but at Air Canada, according to the policies of UA I have to pay for the baggage. Has this ever happened to you before?

Air Canada fjerner h\u00e5ndbagage fra deres Basic billetter. AC har deres grunde, og vi kan have en ordentlig snak om, hvorvidt det er godt eller d\u00e5rligt for flyselskabet. Men indl\u00e6g der bare brokker sig over den nye politik bliver slettet, som regel 1 siger. Lad os pr\u00f8ve at holde diskussionen herinde, hvis det kan lade sig g\u00f8re, eller i en af de eksisterende tr\u00e5de. Det bliver ikke s\u00e5 strengt som under strejken, men lad os se, hvordan det g\u00e5r. EDIT: Hvis I gerne vil vide mere om, hvorfor flyselskaber g\u00f8r s\u00e5dan noget, kan jeg varmt anbefale podcasten Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Desv\u00e6rre d\u00f8de v\u00e6rten, fly-LEGENDEN og tidligere Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza for nylig af komplikationer pga. ALS. Men Scott Mcartney, en tidligere flyjournalist og bare en k\u00e6mpe inden for branchekendskab, holder den k\u00f8rende. Lyt til den. Her er detaljerne: Air Canada Economy Basic billetter k\u00f8bt den 3. januar 2025 eller senere inkluderer ikke l\u00e6ngere h\u00e5ndbagage. Kunder m\u00e5 kun medbringe en (1) personlig genstand n\u00e5r de rejser: inden for Canada til og fra USA (inkl. Hawaii og Puerto Rico) til og fra Mexico, Centralamerika og Caribien Standard regler for bagage g\u00e6lder. Fra den 21. januar 2025, vil den nye Basic billet stadig inkludere gratis pladsreservation ved check-in for kunder, der ikke har betalt for at v\u00e6lge deres pladser p\u00e5 forh\u00e5nd. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

F\u00fcr die Flugzonen 1 bis 4, 6 und 7 k\u00f6nnen Sie sich zwischen 5 kg, 10 kg, 15 kg oder 20 kg entscheiden.

Handgep\u00e4ck Flugzonen Wieviel Handgep\u00e4ck Sie mitnehmen k\u00f6nnen, richtet sich nach Ihrem Flugziel und dem gew\u00e4hlten Tarif. Der Economy Zero Tarif beinhaltet als Handgep\u00e4ck eine kleine Tasche. Sie k\u00f6nnen ein weiteres Handgep\u00e4ckst\u00fcck bis 3 Stunden vor Abflug \u00fcber Meine Buchung hinzubuchen, wenn Sie in der Economy Class reisen \u2013 und das schon ab 9,99 \u20ac. F\u00fcr alle anderen Tarife ist es nicht m\u00f6glich, Handgep\u00e4ck dazuzubuchen. Sollten Sie dennoch mit mehr Handgep\u00e4ck reisen oder wird das maximal zul\u00e4ssige Gewicht \u00fcbrschritten, erheben wir am Flughafen ein Entgelt f\u00fcr \u00dcbergep\u00e4ck. Weitere Informationen zum Thema Handgep\u00e4ck finden Sie hier. \u00dcbergep\u00e4ck Flugzonen \u00dcbersteigt Ihr Gep\u00e4ck die im Tarif inkludierte Freigep\u00e4ckmenge, werden Ihnen am Flughafen \u00dcbergep\u00e4cktarife berechnet. Planen Sie daher vorausschauend und reisen Sie entspannt, ohne sich am Flughafen um zus\u00e4tzliche Kosten sorgen zu m\u00fcssen. Wenn Sie mit mehr Gep\u00e4ck als geplant reisen, nutzen Sie die M\u00f6glichkeit, bis zu 8 Stunden vor Ihrem Abflug zus\u00e4tzliches Gep\u00e4ck online hinzuzubuchen. Weitere Informationen zu den Preisen f\u00fcr \u00dcbergep\u00e4ck finden Sie hier. H\u00e4ufig gestellte Fragen Kann ich mehr Gep\u00e4ck f\u00fcr meinen Condor Flug am Flughafen nachbuchen? Wenn Sie am Flughafen zus\u00e4tzliches Gep\u00e4ck aufgeben wollen, das \u00fcber Ihren Tarif hinausgeht, fallen \u00dcbergep\u00e4ckgeb\u00fchren an. Wir raten Ihnen daher, Zusatzgep\u00e4ck vorab online zu buchen. Kann ich mein Gep\u00e4ck vor Ort am Flughafen wiegen? Ja, an den meisten Flugh\u00e4fen stehen Gep\u00e4ckwaagen zur Verf\u00fcgung. Wieviel Gep\u00e4ck darf ich bei Condor mitnehmen? Wie viel aufzugebendes Gep\u00e4ck Sie auf einem Condor Flug mit DE-Flugnummer oder einem Marabu-Flug mit DI-Flugnummer mitnehmen d\u00fcrfen, h\u00e4ngt vom gebuchten Tarif und der Flugstrecke ab. Eine \u00dcbersicht zu den Gep\u00e4ckbestimmungen finden Sie hier. F\u00fcr Kleinkinder unter 2 Jahren gibt es besondere Gep\u00e4ckregeln. Kann ich die Condor Freigep\u00e4ckmenge aufteilen? Auf Condor Fl\u00fcgen, die das Weight Concept nutzen, darf das Freigep\u00e4ck beliebig auf die Mitreisenden verteilt werden. Ausnahmen sind Fl\u00fcge in die USA und nach Kanada. Dies gilt die f\u00fcr gemeinsam unter einer Buchungsnummer gebuchte Fl\u00fcge. Die Aufteilung betrifft nur das aufzugebende Gep\u00e4ck, nicht das Handgep\u00e4ck. Trotzdem m\u00fcssen die Maximalgrenzen eingehalten werden. So werden die Sicherheits- und Arbeitsschutzbedingungen f\u00fcr das Flughafenpersonal erf\u00fcllt. Jedes Gep\u00e4ckst\u00fcck darf h\u00f6chstens 32 kg wiegen. Die Ma\u00dfe (L\u00e4nge + Breite + H\u00f6he) m\u00fcssen zusammen unter 158 cm liegen. Bei Zu- und Abbringerfl\u00fcgen mit anderen Airlines k\u00f6nnen andere Regeln gelten. Gibt es gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigere Gep\u00e4ckbestimmungen f\u00fcr Langstreckenfl\u00fcge bei Condor? Ja, Condor erlaubt auf Langstreckenfl\u00fcgen mehr Gep\u00e4ck. In der Economy Class k\u00f6nnen Passagiere bis zu 23 kg aufgeben. Das h\u00e4ngt von der Flugzone ab. In der Premium Economy Class ist das Limit bis zu 32 kg. In der Business Class d\u00fcrfen Passagiere sogar 2 G\u00fcnstig mehr Gep\u00e4ck mitnehmen + 5 kg schon ab \u20ac 19 . 99 Gep\u00e4ck dazubuchen Bis 8 Stunden vor Abflug buchen Das k\u00f6nnte Sie auch interessieren Aufzugebendes Gep\u00e4ck Gep\u00e4ckversp\u00e4tung Weiterempfehlen facebook Condor  Attraktive Flugangebote, exklusive Rabatt-Aktionen sowie spannende Neuigkeiten aus der Condor-Welt.

That\u2019s why one of the first things you should do before travelling is to double-check the carry on luggage size allowed by the airline you're flying with. This guide will give you domestic and international carry-on size charts, covering major airlines in the US, UK, EU, and parts of Asia. We\u2019ll also explain how to distinguish between a carry on bag and a personal item. All of this will help you get through airport checks smoothly \u2013 and avoid paying extra for oversized baggage. What Is Carry On? Carry-on is a simple way of referring to the items you\u2019re allowed to take with you into the cabin when you board a flight. These items, often dubbed cabin bags or hand luggage, typically are small backpacks, tote bags, or compact suitcases. Inside, you might pack personal essentials like a change of clothes, toiletries, travel documents, your phone, laptop, and other small valuables (basically in-flight essentials). Your carry-on needs to fit under the seat in front of you. Unlike checked baggage, which goes in the aircraft\u2019s hold, carry-on luggage stays with you during the flight. You can store it either in the overhead locker above your seat or under the seat in front of you. Some even travel with a carry-on only as they find this approach more liberating than sticking to a wheeled suitcase. Because space is limited in these areas, airlines usually set size and weight limits to ensure comfort and safety for everyone onboard. Many travellers often wonder, \u201cCan a 24 inch bag be a carry-on?\u201d The answer depends on the airline. Most carriers allow a maximum length of 22 inches (around 56cm), including handles and wheels. However, some airlines (like Southwest) may accept bags up to 24 inches (roughly 61cm), as long as they meet the overall size and weight restrictions. Below, you\u2019ll find a handy summary of cabin bag rules from nearly 60 popular airlines around the world. We\u2019ve highlighted each airline\u2019s restrictions in detail, and also noted whether they allow personal items (more on that in the next section).

Delta\u2019s carry-on size limit is 22 inches, so a 22.5-inch bag may be refused at the gate if it doesn\u2019t fit within those dimensions.

So what should you bring as your carry-on?Technically, you can use almost any bag as your carry-on. A wheeled suitcase, a tote, even a small duffel. But here\u2019s the thing: it still has to fit your airline\u2019s carry on luggage size limits. And those rules? They\u2019re not always the same, and not always easy to figure out.So why make things harder than they need to be? Skip the stress of measuring and second-guessing. All you really need is a CabinZero backpack.Our bags are designed to fit the carry-on size rules of most major airlines, including 40x20x25 cm, 40x30x20 cm, 45x36x20 cm, and 55x40x20 cm. And the best part? There\u2019s still plenty of room to pack everything you need for several days away.

Check the Dimension Before Your FlightMost airlines allow carry-on bags up to 22 inches (56 cm) tall, 18 inches (45 cm) wide, and 10 inches (25 cm) deep. And that includes any wheels, top handles, and any side pockets.But that doesn\u2019t mean you can skip checking. We always recommend that you visit your airline\u2019s website before your trip to double-check the allowed carry-on luggage size. It only takes a minute, and it can save you a lot of trouble at the airport.Some low-cost airlines (like Ryanair or Wizz Air) are known for having stricter size rules. They do this to reduce overhead bin use and speed up boarding. In contrast, full-service airlines such as British Airways or Qatar Airways might offer a bit more flexibility, especially if you\u2019re flying business or first class.In case you're unsure how to measure your bag, here's how we measure ours:Start by placing your bag on a table or some other flat surface. Stand it upright with telescopic handles (if any) retracted.Measure the height from the top of the bag (the top handle usually) to the ground. Don't forget to include the wheels!Measure the width by taking the bag from side to side at its widest point:For hard-shell bags, you can place the bag on its back and measure across.For backpacks or soft-sided bags, it\u2019s better to place the bag as you would normally carry it, and then measure across the widest point. Just remember to include any side pockets or straps that stick out. This will give you a more accurate idea of your carry on luggage size and how much space the bag takes up when fully packed.Take the depth from the rear of the bag to the front, accounting for any expanded areas or bulging due to packing.Once you\u2019ve got the height, width, and depth, just add them together. That will give you the total linear size. After packing, your bag still needs to fit within the airline\u2019s limit.The more accurately you measure your bag, the easier it is to follow airline rules.2. Don\u2019t Forget Weight LimitIf your hand luggage is too big, there\u2019s a chance the airline crew might stop you at the gate. They may also ask you to put it in the hold with the checked bags. Either way, it\u2019s best to go for hand luggage that\u2019s light enough for you to lift and stow in the overhead compartment without a struggle.Just like with the carry on luggage size, always double-check the weight allowance on your airline\u2019s official website before your flight. The most common way to weigh your hand luggage is by using a home scale: either a luggage scale, a bathroom scale, or a mix of both.A quick tip: Try to keep your bag at least 1.3 kg lighter than the airline\u2019s maximum hand luggage allowance. That\u2019s because home scales and airport scales might not always give the same reading. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry!Now, think about what suits your journey best. It could be a small suitcase or a travel backpack with a laptop compartment. Just make sure it fits within your airline\u2019s carry on luggage size limits. The key here is to pick one that\u2019s as lightweight as possible when empty, like a CabinZero backpack, which can weigh as little as 600g. That will give you more freedom to pack what you really need without wasting precious weight on the bag itself.3. Pack SmartWhat\u2019s more, here are a few simple tricks that can come in handy if you want to travel light with just a carry-on and still fit in as much as possible:Use packing cubes - They help keep things tidy and compress your clothes so you can fit more. We also use them to separate clean and dirty clothes, shoes, or even to store electronics safely away from moisture.Make better use of space with packing cubes by CabinZero.Avoid overpacking or bringing unnecessary items - Don\u2019t throw anything \u2018just in case\u2019 into your carry-on luggage. A well-organised carry-on is easier to carry, and it\u2019ll give you more room to bring back souvenirs.Wear your heaviest or chunkiest clothes on the plane - like a thick coat, hiking boots or chunky trainers. And if you don\u2019t mind a bit of heat or a few curious stares at the airport, layer up with a few extra shirts or trousers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting around baggage fees, as long as it\u2019s within the rules!Use a TSA-approved lock - On full or smaller regional flights, airlines frequently run out of overhead bin space and require passengers to gate-check their carry-on bags at the last minute. When your bag leaves your possession to go into the hold, you will want it to be securely locked.4. Know The Differences Between Carry On vs Personal ItemsThe most important difference between a carry on bag and a personal item is size, specifically your airline's carry on luggage size. A carry-on is usually bigger and will fit in the overhead compartment, while a personal item is smaller and will fit under the seat in front of you.Wrapping UpTurns out, getting your head around carry on luggage size rules isn\u2019t that tricky after all, right? You can save the size chart we've shared in this post, or simply take a few minutes to check your airline\u2019s website before you start packing. And one more thing \u2013 why not choose a CabinZero bag as your travel buddy? Our designs fit even the strictest airline rules. From today on, pack more and stress less! FAQs Which Items Can And Can't I Take In Hand Luggage? In general, most everyday items are allowed in your hand luggage. These can include clothes, a few prescribed medicines, baby essentials, perfume and liquid toiletries in containers no larger than 100ml. Laptops and tablets are also fine to carry in your cabin bag. Anything outside of these basics is usually not allowed. Especially sharp or pointed objects with blades over 6 cm, flammable items (like fireworks), or anything that could be used as a weapon. What Happens If My Carry-On Is Too Big? If your bag goes over the allowed carry on luggage size, the airline will likely ask you to check it in at the gate \u2013 and yes, you\u2019ll probably have to pay a fee. The amount depends on the airline and your destination. But it\u2019s usually more expensive than if you had booked checked baggage in advance with your ticket. Is There A Standard International Carry-On Size? Not really. While most major airlines around the world allow carry-on bags up to around 56 cm (22 inches), some low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe can be stricter, with limits closer to 53 cm (21 inches). So the best thing you can do is check your airline\u2019s rules before you fly.

Get to know the country you\u2019re moving to.Whether it\u2019s Asia, America, Australia or a European country, the advice is always thesame: get to know the country before moving.Why?Every country is unique and has its own way of operating.As a result, it makes sense to know as much as possible about the country before youarrive.Research the local job market; is it booming or stagnating?Are jobs attractive to you in good supply in your chosen country?Understand the currency and how it will help or hinder your everyday life.If you\u2019re lucky enough to have secured a job before you move, work out how much of your salary will go towards rent, taxes, food and transport.Think about potential language barriers.Will you live in an English-speaking country, or will your mastery of a second languagehelp you thrive in your new surroundings?2. Make sure all of your documents are correct and in date.Many people with dreams of a new life abroad are hindered by red tape because they didn\u2019t know the issues existed.One example is that your passport needs to have at least six months left on it to travel to most countries in Europe.Familiarise yourself with your destination country\u2019s immigration rules surrounding visasand passports.Luckily, there\u2019s a thriving ex-pat community online, with forums jam-packed withinformation from people who made your exact journey.They\u2019ll be able to guide you on what documents you need and advise you on things youwon\u2019t necessarily find on a government website.One example of a helpful forum to find lots of information from people with greatexperience is the Expat Forum.3. Before you move abroad, sell your larger items.Surprisingly, many people decide to transport all of their worldly possessions to their new home country.But this is expensive and time-consuming. You can expect delays in getting your items of anything up to a couple of months.You might not be able to visualise your life without your comfy La-Z-Boy recliner chair or that mattress that allows you to sleep a solid eight hours every night. But there\u2019s another way.Sell your larger items on Gumtree, eBay, Facebook Marketplace or Vinted.And once you arrive in your new country buy new ones. You\u2019ll be surprised that many of the larger items you want can be significantly cheaper depending on where you visit.4. Find out how much money you need to satisfy your destination country\u2019s financial requirements.Most countries accept immigrants if they abide by specific rules and plan to contribute to their new country\u2019s economy.However, before being accepted into the country, you\u2019ll most likely be asked to prove how you will support yourself in the short term.Each country has its own pre-requisites but expect to be asked to prove you have money in your bank account to support yourself.This could be anything from a few thousand pounds right up to tens of thousands of pounds.To find out more about your new country\u2019s financial requirements, type into Google:[Country name] and \u2018settlement funds\u2019.5. Plan how to get all of your essentials to your new home.In tip three, we mentioned selling your larger items and buying new ones when you arrive.This isn\u2019t always possible for various reasons, including items that are of sentimental value.If that\u2019s the case for you, consider using a traditional removals company to help you transport those larger items.Ask important questions to the removals company like, \u201cWhen will my items arrive at my new home?\u201d and \u201cCan I track items?\u201d.For smaller items, and personal effects, up to 30kg, why not use My Baggage?

Understand the weather.The weather in a country dictates a lot of your preparation.For a Canadian winter, you\u2019ll need thermal coats, socks, hats and gloves.And for a Florida summer, you\u2019ll want to consider air conditioning, beachwear and loose-fitting clothes.In addition, the weather of a country also brings about other awkward things to factor in.Some of us arrive home from a week in Spain with more than just a few freckles.That\u2019s because, when we\u2019re not used to a climate, we can also be a feast for the local (un)friendly mosquito, who enjoys a meal at our expense.Find out as much as you can about the climate and find out about the bugs that thrive there and how best to protect your skin.7. Research the culture of your new home.One of the best things about moving to a new country is immersing yourself in a newculture.You\u2019ll enjoy a front-row seat to a hotbed of authentic food, arts, architecture, areas of outstanding natural beauty and much more.But cultural differences can also cause some alarm if you\u2019re not used to doing things a certain way.Let\u2019s take one example.You\u2019re in a restaurant in London and enjoy a beautiful meal and excellent service.You don\u2019t feel pressured into it but give your server a \u00a310 tip on top of the \u00a3100 bill.Contrast that with enjoying a similarly lovely meal in a New York restaurant.You receive your bill of $100 and tip the server $10.However, that can (and most likely will) be seen as an insult; the typically expected tip in New York is 15-20%.That\u2019s an extreme example, of course, but it\u2019s a good idea to try and understand the culture of your new country to avoid any embarrassing or awkward situations.8. Driving and communications.Two of the most important things to anyone that moves abroad is independence but the ability to remain in touch with loved ones back home.And in the modern era, we feel most independent when we know we have the ability to hop into our car and drive somewhere.But each country has a different transport infrastructure, and it\u2019s good to know what to expect before you get behind the steering wheel.For example, if you\u2019re moving from America to the UK, you\u2019ll want to know that drivers travel on the road&#39;s left-hand side in the UK.Oh, and you\u2019ll want to know that steering wheels in the UK are on the right side of the car, not the left side you\u2019re used to back in the US of A.In 2021, super-fast Wi-Fi and 5G are a minimum expectation.And you\u2019ll want to keep in touch with family back home through WhatsApp, Zoom and Skype.But to do that, you\u2019ll, of course, need decent Wi-Fi.Before you move abroad, research Wi-Fi deals and find out from ex-pats what your new country\u2019s 4G and 5G infrastructure is like.ConclusionMoving country can be one of the most exciting and fulfilling things you\u2019ll ever do.But like any grand plan, you just have to work out the finer details. Luckily, many people have already trodden this path.And if you get active in the months before your big move on Ex-Pat forums and Facebook groups, you\u2019ll be able to learn from their mistakes and thrive with their benefit of hindsight.

They will also receive $5 each paycheck for uniform maintenance such as alterations and dry cleaning. As a representative of SkyWest, our flight attendants are expected to follow all uniform and appearance guidelines. Extreme hair styles and colors are not permitted. Visible tattoos are permitted with limitations based on dimension and location. Tattoos that do not fall within these guidelines must be covered by the uniform or with skin tone compatible tattoo makeup. Bandages are not an approved form of tattoo coverage.

Gauges must be plugged with clear or skin toned plugs and must not exceed \u00bd\u201d. Other facial, mouth, or tongue piercings are not permitted. Each new flight attendant can expect to be on reserve until they build enough seniority to become a line holder. The time spent on reserve varies depending on the growth within the assigned domicile. When a flight attendant is on reserve, they are on-call and expected to be available during assigned reserve blocks to cover trips due to sick calls, vacations, etc. While on reserve, flight attendants may be away from home up to five days a week and scheduled to work up to 14 hours each day. If contacted to work a trip while on reserve, flight attendants must be checked in at the airport and ready for duty within two hours. It can be very difficult to commute while on reserve and it is highly recommended that flight attendants relocate to their assigned domicile. All assigned trips will begin and end in the assigned domicile. SkyWest flight attendants on reserve will not exceed 19 duty days per month. Training Initial New Hire Training: Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training is held in Salt Lake City, Utah at the SkyWest Airlines Hangar. The first phase of training will take place for 35 consecutive days with three non-consecutive days off. Training times will vary and can last up to 10 hours per day.

Crewmember pay dates are the 7th and 22nd of each month. SkyWest will provide private hotel accommodations to trainees who live outside a 40-mile radius of the SkyWest training facility. Professional behavior is expected at all times throughout training, as well as at the training hotel. A shuttle to and from the SkyWest hangar/training facility is provided. Trainees should be prepared to cover all expenses during training outside of hotel accommodations and transportation to and from the training facility. Expenses include, but are not limited to, meals (including delivery costs), groceries, training attire and laundry facilities. Additional costs to consider when financially preparing for your new career as a flight attendant include: relocation expenses, if you are not assigned a base in the city where you currently live; shoes; and luggage and a lunch bag that meet requirements (if not already purchased for training). Trainees will not receive holiday or per diem pay while in training. If applicable, domestic round trip air travel will be provided to and from Salt Lake City for training from a location our partners serve. Home Study Packet Trainees will receive a home study packet at least 10 days before attending Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training and will be tested on the contents during the first day. Failure to pass will result in dismissal from the training. Domicile Domiciles will be assigned following the end of Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training. Assignments will be based on operational need, as well as company seniority. Those who prefer a different domicile than they are assigned may submit a transfer request after they have completed IOE. Transfer times vary depending on the growth in the desired domicile Initial Operating Experience The Initial Operating Experience (IOE) is the second phase of Flight Attendant Training.Once IOE has been successfully completed, the new hire will be assigned a reserve work schedule at his/her assigned domicile. If relocation is required, the new hire will be given four days to relocate to the assigned domicile upon completion of initial new hire ground training (prior to IOE). SkyWest will provide up to three nights of hotel accommodations at a trainee\u2019s domicile if needed.Thirty to 90 days following IOE, the third and final phase of Initial New Hire Flight Attendant Training will be conducted. This final phase, known as the Initial Line Check, must be completed with a satisfactory score. Seniority Seniority is determined by the flight attendant\u2019s date of hire (the first day of training) and the last four digits of their Social Security number. Essential Duties and Responsibilities SkyWest operates flights every day of the year, requiring flight attendants to work a rotating schedule with variable hours that include holidays and weekends. Flight attendants need to have the stamina needed to work up to 16 hours per day with frequent change in climate and weather .

Air Canada entfernt Handgep\u00e4ck aus Basic-Tickets. AC hat seine Gr\u00fcnde und wir k\u00f6nnen eine fundierte Diskussion dar\u00fcber f\u00fchren, inwiefern dies f\u00fcr die Fluggesellschaft gut oder schlecht ist. Beitr\u00e4ge, die lediglich \u00fcber die neue Richtlinie meckern, werden jedoch gem\u00e4\u00df Regel 1 entfernt. Versuchen wir, die Diskussion m\u00f6glichst hier oder in einem der bereits etablierten Threads fortzusetzen. Es wird nicht so streng sein wie w\u00e4hrend des Streiks, aber mal sehen, wie es weitergeht. EDIT: Wenn Sie erfahren m\u00f6chten, warum Fluggesellschaften solche Dinge tun, kann ich Ihnen den Podcast \u201eAirlines Confidential\u201c w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Leider ist der Gastgeber, die Fluggesellschaft LEGEND und ehemalige CEO von Spirit, Ben Baldanza, k\u00fcrzlich an den Folgen von ALS verstorben.

However, for domestic travel, or travel within the EU, customs is not usually required. In all cases, you will pass through security checks, to which it\u2019s likely your ID and Documents will be checked, so it\u2019s a good idea to have these documents ready and available throughout your journey.Entry requirements vary from country to country. It\u2019s very important that you research the exact requirements specific to you before you travel, as certain countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, and possibly bank statements. Your passport must also be valid for the full duration of your stay, with some countries requiring at least 6 months validity. However, all requirements will differ and are subject to your specific circumstances, such as duration of stay, purpose of travel, and the regulations that the country has set.We recommend sourcing information about entry requirements from the country\u2019s official websites.Connecting FlightsConnecting flights refer to you taking multiple flights in order to reach your destination. This results in having a longer journey time, however, it\u2019s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not. This is why more and more travellers are travelling light by shipping their luggage ahead.Many low-cost airlines don't offer connecting flights. This means it's your responsibility to manage your onward connections, and collect your baggage after each flight.If you\u2019re unsure, we recommend that you contact your airline directly.\u26d4 Avoid Airline Baggage Fees \u26a0\ufe0fShip your luggage with My Baggage and avoid large airline baggage fees.TrustpilotAdding additional baggage to your flight or incurring excess baggage fees at the airport can considerably increase the overall cost of travel.Thankfully, My Baggage offers a convenient and cost-effective luggage shipping service that allows you to ship a massive 30KG/66lbs per suitcase at fantastic low rates.

Inaalis na ng Air Canada ang carry-on baggage sa mga Basic Ticket. May mga dahilan ang AC at pwede tayong magkaroon ng isang maayos na pag-uusap kung paano ito maganda o masama para sa airline. Gayunpaman, ang mga post na puro reklamo lamang tungkol sa bagong patakaran ay tatanggalin ayon sa rule 1. Subukan nating panatilihin ang pag-uusap dito kung maaari o sa isa sa mga naitatag na thread na. Hindi ito magiging kasinghigpit ng panahon ng welga pero tingnan natin kung ano ang mangyayari. EDIT: Kung gusto ninyo ng impormasyon kung bakit ginagawa ng mga airline ang mga ganitong bagay, lubos kong inirerekomenda ang podcast na Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Sa kasamaang palad, ang host, airline LEGEND at dating Spirit CEO na si Ben Baldanza ay kamakailan lamang ay pumanaw dahil sa komplikasyon ng ALS. Gayunpaman, si Scott Mcartney, isang dating mamamahayag ng Airline at isang higante sa kaalaman sa industriya, ay patuloy na ginagawa ito. Pakinggan ninyo ito. Narito ang mga detalye: Ang mga tiket na Air Canada Economy Basic fare na binili noong Enero 3, 2025 o pagkatapos nito ay hindi na kasama ang carry-on baggage. Ang mga customer ay papayagan lamang na magdala ng isang (1) personal na gamit kapag naglalakbay: sa loob ng Canada papunta at galing sa U.S. (kasama ang Hawaii at Puerto Rico) papunta at galing sa Mexico, Central America at Caribbean Ang standard na patakaran sa baggage fare ay mananatili. Simula Enero 21, 2025, ang bagong Basic fare ay may kasamang libreng pagpili ng upuan sa check-in para sa mga customer na hindi nagbayad ng dagdag na bayad para pumili ng upuan nang maaga. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

Air Canada akan buang beg tangan dari Tiket Basic. AC ada sebab diorang sendiri dan kita boleh bincang secara berinformasi sama ada benda ni bagus atau tak bagus untuk syarikat penerbangan tu. Tapi, posting yang cuma merungut pasal polisi baru ni akan dipadam macam yang ada dalam peraturan 1. Jom cuba bincang kat sini kalau boleh atau kat salah satu thread yang dah ada. Takkan seketat masa mogok dulu tapi kita tengok macam mana. EDIT: Kalau korang nak tahu kenapa syarikat penerbangan buat benda macam ni, aku sangat rekomen podcast Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Malangnya, hos dia, seorang LEGENDA penerbangan dan bekas CEO Spirit, Ben Baldanza baru meninggal dunia sebab komplikasi ALS. Tapi, Scott Mcartney, bekas wartawan penerbangan dan memang pakar dalam industri ni, teruskan jugak. Dengar la. Ni dia detailnya: Tiket Air Canada Economy Basic yang dibeli pada atau selepas 3 Januari 2025, takkan termasuk bagasi tangan lagi.

Mula 21 Januari 2025, tambang Basic yang baru masih akan termasuk penentuan tempat duduk percuma semasa daftar masuk untuk pelanggan yang tak bayar yuran untuk pilih tempat duduk awal. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

Air Canada lagi ngilangin bawaan kabin dari tiket Basic. AC punya alasannya sendiri dan kita bisa diskusi dengan kepala dingin tentang gimana ini bagus atau jelek buat maskapainya. Tapi, postingan yang cuma ngomel-ngomel soal kebijakan barunya bakal dihapus, sesuai aturan 1. Coba kita usahain diskusi di sini aja ya, kalau bisa, atau di salah satu thread yang udah ada. Gak bakal seserius pas mogok kerja kemarin, tapi kita liat aja gimana nanti. EDIT: Kalau kalian penasaran kenapa maskapai suka ngelakuin hal kayak gini, gue banget rekomendasiin podcast Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Sayangnya, host-nya, LEGEND di dunia penerbangan dan mantan CEO Spirit, Ben Baldanza, baru-baru ini meninggal karena komplikasi ALS. Tapi, Scott Mcartney, mantan jurnalis penerbangan dan emang jagonya soal pengetahuan industri ini, masih lanjutin podcast-nya. Dengerin aja deh. Ini detailnya: Tiket Air Canada Economy Basic yang dibeli mulai tanggal 3 Januari 2025, gak termasuk bawaan kabin lagi. Penumpang cuma boleh bawa satu (1) barang pribadi pas lagi perjalanan: di dalam Kanada ke dan dari AS (termasuk Hawaii dan Puerto Rico) ke dan dari Meksiko, Amerika Tengah, dan Karibia Aturan biaya bagasi standar tetap berlaku. Mulai 21 Januari 2025, tiket Basic yang baru tetep termasuk penunjukan kursi gratis pas check-in buat penumpang yang belum bayar buat pilih kursi mereka sebelumnya. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

Your free baggage allowance is based on either the total amount of weight or on how many pieces of luggage you have. This is called the weight or piece concept.The weight concept applies to most routes. The piece concept applies only on flights to and from the Americas and Africa. Your allowance depends on where you\u2019re traveling, your fare, and your travel class.There are general rules and guidelines for baggage allowance on Emirates flights. To check the baggage rules specific to your journey, and how much extra baggage will cost, visit Manage Your Booking. If you\u2019re an Emirates Skywards Platinum, Gold, or Silver member, you could also enjoy extra baggage allowance on routes that use the weight concept. When traveling on piece concept routes on Emirates flights only, Emirates Skywards Platinum and Gold members are eligible for 1 additional piece of checked baggage at 23 kg per piece in Economy Class and 32 kg per piece in Business Class and First Class over the ticketed limit.Weight ConceptYour allowance is based on the total weight of all your baggage.You can check in as many bags as you like up to the weight allowance for your travel class. Each individual bag must not weigh more than 32 kg.The weight concept applies to all routes, except when you travel to and from the Americas and from Africa (for tickets issued before August 9, 2021).Class of travel SpecialSaverFlexFlex PlusEconomy Class 20 kg** 25 kg*** 30 kg35 kg**25 kg in Economy Special for flights between UAE and India.***30 kg in Economy Saver for journeys originating in Australia and New Zealand for tickets issued on/after 26 November 2019Class of travelBaggage allowanceBusiness Class40 kgFirst Class 50 kgChecked Baggage Dimensions for weight conceptThe total dimensions (length + width + height) of an individual bag should not exceed 300 cm (118 inches).

If an individual item has total dimensions greater than these specifications, it can\u2019t be checked in as baggage and will need to be sent as cargo or freight.Interline baggage policy If your travel starts in the United States and the first airline on your booking is not Emirates, different rules may apply.Interline flights are flights that are on the same ticket as your Emirates flights but are operated by another airline and do not have an Emirates flight number (Emirates flight numbers start with EK). These airlines baggage allowances may be different from Emirates. You can read the interline partner baggage allowances for information on allowances and charges for carry-on baggage and checked baggage.Checking more than 15 bagsFor operational and safety reasons, if you are checking more than 15 pieces of baggage, we may not be able to transport all of your extra baggage on the same flight as you.If that happens:We\u2019ll carry your extra baggage on the next available flight and deliver your bags to you within five days.Our excess baggage  and  apply.The Montreal Convention 1999 or the Warsaw Convention 1929 (as amended) will apply to your extra baggage as though it had been carried on the same flight as you. Your baggage will only be considered delayed under these conventions if it does not arrive within five days after your flight.

Beb\u00e9 con boleto de adulto Si prefieres que tu beb\u00e9 viaje en un asiento propio, puedes comprar un boleto de adulto y llevarlo en una silla para auto aprobada por la FAA. Revisa si la silla es apta en las etiquetas de seguridad pegadas en ella. Todos los ni\u00f1os a partir de 2 a\u00f1os de edad deben viajar en el asiento del avi\u00f3n. Viajando con dos beb\u00e9s Si planeas viajar con dos beb\u00e9s y eres el \u00fanico adulto en la reservaci\u00f3n, uno de ellos puede disfrutar del viaje c\u00f3modamente en su silla de auto ajustada al asiento pagando la tarifa completa, mientras que tu otro peque\u00f1o puede volar sin costo adicional en tu regazo.

Todo lo que debes saber antes de abordar tu vuelo Documentos de viaje Alimentos en el equipaje Recuerda llevar su identificaci\u00f3n A pesar de que tu beb\u00e9 no pague boleto, es necesario confirmar su edad e identidad antes de abordar el vuelo. Para ello, puedes presentar su acta de nacimiento o pasaporte. Si tu beb\u00e9 tiene 7 d\u00edas de nacido y no cuenta con alguno de los documentos mencionados, no te preocupes, puedes presentar el Certificado de alumbramiento/nacimiento. Para vuelos internacionales, sin importar la edad, tendr\u00e1s que mostrar su pasaporte y, solo en caso de que aplique seg\u00fan el pa\u00eds de destino, la visa correspondiente. Si tienes alguna duda adicional, visita nuestra p\u00e1gina sobre documentos y requisitos de viaje. Tus indispensables de viaje van contigo Sabemos que viajar con un beb\u00e9 significa llevar extras de casi todo y eso incluye su comida. As\u00ed que, si est\u00e1s pensando en llevar f\u00f3rmula para lactantes, leche o comida para tu peque\u00f1o, puedes hacerlo en tu equipaje de mano siempre y cuando los contenedores no superen los 100 mililitros. Eso s\u00ed, si tu destino es Estados Unidos, ten en cuenta que no podr\u00e1s llevar en tu equipaje de mano sustancias en polvo que superen los 350 ml / 12 oz en total. Esto es por norma del gobierno estadounidense. Consejos adicionales para que tu aventura sea todo un \u00e9xito Llega al aeropuerto con suficiente anticipaci\u00f3n, el paso por los controles de seguridad puede tomar m\u00e1s tiempo por la revisi\u00f3n de los art\u00edculos de beb\u00e9 como carriolas o sillas de coche. Los beb\u00e9s suelen estar acostumbrados a un itinerario, intenta planear los horarios de tus vuelos de acuerdo con la rutina de tu peque\u00f1o. Empaca varios cambios de ropa, bolsas de pl\u00e1stico, toallitas y pa\u00f1ales extra en tu equipaje de mano. Considera llevar m\u00e1s f\u00f3rmula o alimento de lo necesario, siempre es mejor estar preparado para posibles imprevistos. Lleva su juguete o peluche favorito. Los objetos familiares son muy \u00fatiles para hacerlos sentir c\u00f3modos en lugares desconocidos para ellos como el avi\u00f3n o el aeropuerto.

Air Canada Basic Tickets se carry-ons hata raha hai. AC ke apne reasons hain aur hum is baare mein ek informed discussion kar sakte hain ki yeh airline ke liye achcha hai ya bura. Lekin, sirf naye policy ke baare mein gussa karne wali posts rule 1 ke hisab se delete kar di jayengi. Agar ho sake toh issi thread mein ya kisi aur pehle se baney hue thread mein discussion rakhne ki koshish karein. Strike ke waqt jitna strict nahi hoga, lekin dekhte hain kaise chalta hai. EDIT: Agar tumhe pata karna hai ki airlines aise kaam kyun karti hain, toh main Airlines Confidential podcast highly recommend karta hu. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Afsos ki baat hai ki host, airline LEGEND aur former Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza ka ALS ki wajah se recently pass away ho gaya. Lekin, Scott Mcartney, ek former Airline journalist aur industry knowledge ka ek bada expert, ise chalata raha hai. Sun ke dekho. Yeh hain details: 3 January 2025 ya uske baad kharide gaye Air Canada Economy Basic fare tickets mein ab carry-on baggage shamil nahi hoga. Customers ko sirf ek (1) personal article lene ki permission hogi jab woh travel karenge: Canada ke andar US se aur US tak (Hawaii aur Puerto Rico bhi shamil) Mexico, Central America aur Caribbean se aur tak Standard baggage fare rules apply honge. 21 January 2025 se, naye Basic fare mein complimentary seat assignment check-in pe customers ke liye rahega jinhone apni seats pehle se select karne ke liye fee nahi di hai. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

You can read through our complete packaging guide to find out more. Customs Information When shipping within the EU, goods do not pass through customs clearance and are therefore do not require customs documentation and are not subject to import tax or duty.

When sending outside of the EU, if your shipment does not have customs documentation attached, it will not make it past your local country border, and you may have to pay return charges to get it back.

Air Canada is removing carry-ons from Basic Tickets. AC has their reasons and we can have an informed discussion on how this is good or bad for the airline. However, posts simply bitching about the new policy will be removed as per rule 1. Let's try to keep the discussion in here if we can or on one of the already established threads. It won't be as strict as during the strike but let's see how it goes. EDIT: If you'd like some into why airlines do things like this, I highly recommend the podcast Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Unfortunately, host , airline LEGEND and former Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza recently passed away from complications due to ALS. However, Scott Mcartney, a former Airline journalist and just a juggernaut of industry knowledge, is keeping it going. Give it a listen. Here are the particulars: Air Canada Economy Basic fare tickets purchased on or after January 3, 2025, will no longer include carry-on baggage. Customers will only be permitted to bring one (1) personal article when travelling: within Canada to and from the U.S. (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico) to and from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Standard baggage fare rules apply. Starting January 21, 2025, the new Basic fare will still include complimentary seat assignment at check-in for customers who have not paid a fee to select their seats in advance. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Related Answers Section Related Answers Air Canada personal item guidelines Air Canada hand baggage weight limits Best tips for booking Air Canada flights How to maximize Aeroplan points effectively Challenges faced while flying with Air Canada Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 Top Posts Reddit reReddit: Top posts of December 4, 2024 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of December 2024 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of 2024 See this post in...

Tuesday, 11 Sep 2018 Airlines are constantly making the headlines these days, due to their ever-changing hand luggage policies. New weight restrictions, size limitations, and the introduction of charges for cabin baggage have turned a simple matter into a confusing one.To help you make sense of it all, here we take a look at the hand luggage policies of some of the UK\u2019s most popular airlines.British Airways Hand LuggageWe start with the UK\u2019s legacy carrier - British Airways - which has pared back a lot of its little luxuries recently. Nonetheless, the airline still offers one of the more generous hand luggage allowances. Economy passengers may bring on board one larger item measuring 56 x 45 x 25 cm, PLUS a smaller personal item, such as a handbag or laptop. Each of these items must weigh no more than 23 kg, which is a hefty allowance compared to many other airlines.Virgin Atlantic Hand LuggageBritish Airways\u2019 transatlantic competitor, Virgin Atlantic, also allows a larger cabin bag measuring no more than 56 x 36 x 25 cm, plus a personal item. However, the maximum permitted weight of the larger item is no more than 10 kg, a lot less than with British Airways.Flybe Hand LuggageNext up is Flybe, which, despite being a budget airline, still offers the convenience of a larger cabin bag as well as a personal item. The larger item must not exceed 55 x 35 x 20 cm and must weigh no more than 10 kg.easyJet Hand LuggageWith easyJet passengers have to fit all of their luggage within one cabin bag measuring 56 x 45 x 25 cm, as a second personal item is not permitted. This can prove irritating for passengers who must rummage in their larger bag to find items such as passports and wallets. Easyjet make up for this in some respect by not imposing any weight restrictions.Wizz Air Hand LuggageThings get a lot more complicated when we look at Wizz Air\u2019s hand luggage allowance, which has changed several times in recent years.Currently, customers without Priority Boarding must check their larger cabin bag measuring no more than 55 x 40 x 23 cm at the check-in desk, and may do so free of charge. However, if Priority Boarding is purchased for between \u20ac5 and \u20ac12, passengers may bring on board their larger cabin bag. All passengers may carry a small personal item measuring no more than 40 x 30 x 18 cm.As of 1st November, the only free hand luggage allowance on Wizz Air flights will be a personal item measuring no more than 40 x 30 x 20 cm and weighing no more than 10 kg. Customers who purchase Priority Boarding will be able to bring a 10 kg suitcase on board with them, providing it measures no more than 55 x 40 x 23 cm. Passengers will have to pay a fee to check a 10 kg bag. Ryanair Hand LuggageEqually confusing is Ryanair\u2019s hand luggage policy, which has changed twice in one year. Currently, all passengers may bring on board a small personal item no larger than 35 x 20 x 20 cm. One 10 kg bag with dimensions of 55 x 40 x 20 cm may be brought to the gate, where non-Priority customers must have their bag checked into the hold.From 1st November 2018, however, passengers will be forced to either pay \u00a38 to check a 10 kg suitcase at bag drop or \u00a36 for Priority Boarding, which allows them to bring their suitcase on board. In November, the size of the small personal item will also increase by 43% to 40 x 20 x 25 cm. It is becoming increasingly clear that airlines don\u2019t want your hand luggage any more than they want your checked luggage. Ryanair and Wizz Air are already charging for the privilege of hand luggage and it is only a matter of time before other airlines follow suit. So why not avoid airline baggage altogether and send your luggage ahead with Send My Bag? Get a Quick Quote Our Most Popular Articles Italian Watchdog Investigates Ryanair Hand Luggage Charges Italy's competition watchdog, Antittrust, is looking into the new hand luggage charges announced by Ryanair in August. Ryanair Changes Hand Luggage Fees Again Ryanair has made changes to its luggage fees, once again!! This time, the changes have been introduced quietly and most passengers will only realise the changes once they are ready to pay for their flights. Ryanair New Baggage Rules for Hand Luggage Ryanair have again announced new baggage rules. This is the second change to their baggage allowance this year. The change means that the only item of hand luggage that can be brought as far as the gate is one small carry-on item. Currently, a larger 10 kg item can be brought as far as the gate, where it is checked into the hold free of charge. Ryanair Earns Billions from Add-Ons A new report has revealed that Ryanair has earned over \u00a31.7 billion in just one year from ancillary revenue, placing the airline among the top 5 airlines for this type of income. The Latest in Ryanair\u2019s History of Add-On Charges Today marks the introduction of Ryanair\u2019s latest baggage fee policy. This is just the latest in a string of baggage policy changes over the years. Ryanair and Wizz Air to Pay the Price for New Baggage Rules Budget airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air have both been hit with fines following the introduction of their new hand luggage policies last year. Together they are being forced to pay \u20ac3 million. Wizz Air New Hand Luggage Allowance Wizz Air has announced changes to its hand luggage allowance that mirror those made by Ryanair at the end of August.

Applicable Law This Agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Florida. All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by mandatory binding arbitration as set forth below. 21. Mandatory Binding Arbitration; Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver 1. General. In the interest of resolving disputes between in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and us agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement and these , and any of our text messaging programs, will be resolved by mandatory, binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these , or your receipt of text messages from us or our service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE , YOU AND US ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE  SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. 2. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 1 above, nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or us to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. 3. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and us will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these , and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting us. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. 4. Notice; Process. If you or us intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by  (\"Notice\"). Our address for Notice is: Attention: Legal, legal@travelpro.com. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). You and us will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and us do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. 5. Fees. If you commence arbitration, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance-based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and us agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or us made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. 6. No Class Actions. YOU AND US AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and us agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and us. 8. Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these  is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these  shall remain in full force and effect. 22.

Air Canada verwijdert handbagage van Basic Tickets. AC heeft zijn redenen en we kunnen een ge\u00efnformeerd gesprek voeren over hoe dit goed of slecht is voor de luchtvaartmaatschappij. Echter, berichten die simpelweg klagen over het nieuwe beleid zullen worden verwijderd volgens regel 1. Laten we proberen het gesprek hier te houden, of in een van de reeds bestaande threads. Het zal niet zo streng zijn als tijdens de staking, maar laten we zien hoe het gaat. EDIT: Als je meer wilt weten over waarom luchtvaartmaatschappijen dit soort dingen doen, raad ik je de podcast Airlines Confidential ten zeerste aan. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Helaas is de host, luchtvaartlegende en voormalig Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza onlangs overleden aan complicaties door ALS. Scott Mcartney, een voormalige luchtvaartjournalist en gewoon een gigant op het gebied van branchekennis, zet het echter voort. Luister ernaar. Hier zijn de details: Air Canada Economy Basic tarief tickets die op of na 3 januari 2025 zijn gekocht, omvatten geen handbagage meer. Klanten mogen alleen \u00e9\u00e9n (1) persoonlijk item meenemen tijdens het reizen: binnen Canada van en naar de VS (inclusief Hawaii en Puerto Rico) van en naar Mexico, Centraal-Amerika en het Caribisch gebied Standaard bagageregels zijn van toepassing. Vanaf 21 januari 2025 omvat het nieuwe Basic tarief nog steeds gratis stoeltoewijzing bij het inchecken voor klanten die geen toeslag hebben betaald om van tevoren hun stoel te selecteren. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 See this post in...

Say goodbye to the nightmare of hauling your suitcase or bags from your home and through train stations, taxis and airports; our baggage shipping service can save you from all of the hassle and stress.What\u2019s more, when you book a bag on your flight, you have to keep in mind your airline\u2019s restrictive baggage weight allowances when packing up all of your personal belongings. It means you may be left with two options, either of which are ideal; paying the extortionate excess baggage fees at the check-in desk, or leaving many of your beloved personal belongings behind. When travelling for any reason, especially long-haul, it\u2019s not ideal.Thankfully, My Baggage allows you to ship a generous 66lb per item at fantastic low rates. You also have the option to pay extra for even heavier bags, if you need to. With My Baggage, you\u2019ll never have to worry about leaving any of your possessions behind.Shipping your excess baggage with My Baggage also makes that eager wait for the appearance of your suitcase at the luggage carousel in the airport a thing of the past.

You can also send boxes and sports equipment. However, for security and customs reasons, there are certain items which are prohibited and cannot be carried, as is standard with most, if not all, shipping companies.It is also important to be aware that there are a number of items that can be carried on our services, however, they are not covered under our compensation cover and would be sent at your own risk. If you choose to send any non-compensation items, please ensure they are packaged appropriately, with plenty of internal packaging to cushion any fragile items.Find out more about My Baggage\u2019s prohibited and non-compensation items.My Baggage also allows you to ship oversized items that may be otherwise difficult or expensive to transport, such as musical instruments, bicycles and sporting equipment.

Not including a customs form can lead to your shipment being unable to leave its country of origin, potentially causing it to be returned to the sender's address, and incurring return shipping fees.When you use My Baggage, all the required customs paperwork is automatically provided for you to complete. Below we've highlighted how we have simplified the customs process.Simplified CustomsMy Baggage specialises in sending personal effects internationally.

This is available online, and via phone and  if you have any questions. We will also submit the correct forms for shipping personal effects on your behalf.Potential of Lower DutiesThe majority of used personal effects shipments sent with My Baggage will have zero duties to pay. This is due to us submitting additional personal effects clearance forms and not simple commercial invoicesCommercial CourierPaper Customs FormsYou may have to print off custom forms and attach these to your items, even if some couriers allow digital customs for commercial goods, they may not provide additional personal effects clearance forms, these are important to avoid customs duties.Basic or No Customs GuidanceMany couriers are set up to ship commercial goods and may not be able to provide advice on shipping personal effects or be able to provide the correct free entry declaration forms for your destination country.Potential of Higher DutiesIf you send your item with a commercial courier you may have to pay duties as it could be cleared as a commercial shipment. Once customs have processed your shipment it can be very difficult to claim your items are personal effects if the correct paperwork was not provided.Fast Luggage DeliveryAt My Baggage, we understand that speed is an important factor when it comes to transporting your personal belongings overseas.

You must include a customs form detailing the contents and purpose of your shipment. Failing to provide this form can lead to delays, with your shipment potentially being held at customs, returned to the sender, and incurring additional fees.To make the process as smooth as possible, My Baggage takes care of the paperwork for you. When you book with us, if customs forms are required, we\u2019ll automatically generate them based on the information you provide. Simply answer a few quick questions, and we\u2019ll submit the forms on your behalf to the customs authorities - saving you time and hassle!Frequently Asked Questions: Luggage Shipping & CustomsAt My Baggage, we know you may have questions about our luggage shipping service and the customs process. But don\u2019t worry - we\u2019re here to help! We\u2019ve compiled answers to the most frequently asked questions to make everything as straightforward as possible.How does luggage shipping work?Shipping your luggage with a courier service like My Baggage is simple and hassle-free. We collect your bags from your door and deliver them to your destination. You\u2019ll get full online tracking, so you can monitor your shipment every step of the way. To get started, just get an instant quote and book your collection online.How long does it take to ship luggage?Delivery times vary depending on where you're shipping to and the service you choose. We offer fast, reliable delivery worldwide, with express options available to some destinations in as little as 1\u20132 days. When you book, we\u2019ll provide an estimated delivery time so you\u2019ll know when to expect your luggage.Do I need to fill out customs forms when sending luggage?For domestic shipments (within the same customs zone, such as the EU, UK, or USA), no customs forms are required. For international shipments, customs clearance is required. When you book with My Baggage, we\u2019ll generate your digital customs forms and any other necessary documents for you to complete online. In some cases, you may also need to provide additional details, such as a passport image page, depending on the country\u2019s requirements. To avoid delays, customs documentation must be in the receiver\u2019s name, as they should be the owner of the shipment. If the sender\u2019s name differs from the receiver\u2019s, customs may reject the shipment. Tip: Ensure both the sender and receiver names match the shipment owner\u2019s name for smooth clearance.Do I need to declare the value of the items inside my luggage?You must declare the value of your items when completing customs forms. To demonstrate that your shipment consists of personal effects, it\u2019s important to describe each item clearly. For example: 4 x Used Black Men's Cotton T-Shirts 1 x Pair Used Brown Leather Shoes (Size 8) 2 x Used Dark Blue Denim Jeans (Size Small) Providing clear and accurate descriptions reduces the risk of customs delays.Will I have to pay customs fees or import duties on my luggage?When shipping used personal effects, keeping a low declared value on customs forms can help minimise the chances of duties or taxes. However, customs fees may still apply depending on: The nature of your shipment The reason for sending (e.g., returning resident vs. sending a gift) The import rules of the destination country Customs decisions are beyond My Baggage\u2019s control, so we recommend checking country-specific regulations.How long does customs clearance take when shipping luggage?Each shipment is subject to customs checks, and clearance times vary depending on: The country\u2019s regulations The accuracy of your customs paperwork The shipment\u2019s contents If your customs forms are completed correctly, your shipment should clear customs smoothly and arrive within the estimated delivery timeframe.Can customs inspect or open my suitcase?All shipments are subject to security and customs inspections, which means customs may open and inspect your shipment. Tip: Do not lock your luggage to avoid delays during customs checks.Do customs rules differ depending on the country I\u2019m shipping to?Each country has its own import rules and regulations, so customs procedures vary based on your destination. We highly recommend researching country-specific customs policies to ensure compliance and prevent unexpected delays or fees.Simplified CustomsMy Baggage specialises in sending personal effects internationally. We offer a simplified customs process to our users and ensure all correct documentation is complete. My Baggage ServiceDigital Customs FormsWe will ask you a number of simple questions so we can create a set of digital custom forms for you. We will submit these forms on your behalf to the customs authority.Customs GuidanceWe offer helpful customs guidance for shipping personal effects. This is available online, and via phone and  if you have any questions. We will also submit the correct forms for shipping personal effects on your behalf.Potential of Lower DutiesThe majority of used personal effects shipments sent with My Baggage will have zero duties to pay. This is due to us submitting additional personal effects clearance forms and not simple commercial invoicesCommercial CourierPaper Customs FormsYou may have to print off custom forms and attach these to your items, even if some couriers allow digital customs for commercial goods, they may not provide additional personal effects clearance forms, these are important to avoid customs duties.Basic or No Customs GuidanceMany couriers are set up to ship commercial goods and may not be able to provide advice on shipping personal effects or be able to provide the correct free entry declaration forms for your destination country.Potential of Higher DutiesIf you send your item with a commercial courier you may have to pay duties as it could be cleared as a commercial shipment. Once customs have processed your shipment it can be very difficult to claim your items are personal effects if the correct paperwork was not provided.Get a quoteCollect fromUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaC\u00f4te d\u2019IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\u00e9union, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweDeliver toUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaC\u00f4te d\u2019IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\u00e9union, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweGet QuoteWhy use a Luggage Shipping Company?There are plenty of great reasons to use a luggage shipping service like My Baggage.

Air Canada fjerner h\u00e5ndbagasje fra Basic-billetter. AC har sine grunner, og vi kan ha en informert diskusjon om hvordan dette er bra eller d\u00e5rlig for flyselskapet. Men innlegg som bare klager over den nye policyen vil bli fjernet i henhold til regel 1. La oss pr\u00f8ve \u00e5 holde diskusjonen her hvis vi kan, eller i en av de allerede etablerte tr\u00e5dene. Det blir ikke like strengt som under streiken, men la oss se hvordan det g\u00e5r. EDIT: Hvis du vil ha litt info om hvorfor flyselskaper gj\u00f8r s\u00e5nt, anbefaler jeg podcasten Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Dessverre gikk programlederen, flyselskap-LEGENDE og tidligere Spirit-sjef Ben Baldanza nylig bort av komplikasjoner p\u00e5 grunn av ALS. Men Scott Mcartney, en tidligere flyjournalist og bare en gigant innen bransjekunnskap, holder det g\u00e5ende. H\u00f8r p\u00e5 det. Her er detaljene: Air Canada Economy Basic-billetter kj\u00f8pt p\u00e5 eller etter 3. januar 2025, vil ikke lenger inkludere h\u00e5ndbagasje. Kunder vil bare f\u00e5 lov til \u00e5 ta med \u00e9n (1) personlig gjenstand n\u00e5r de reiser: innenfor Canada til og fra USA (inkludert Hawaii og Puerto Rico) til og fra Mexico, Mellom-Amerika og Karibia Standard bagasjeregler gjelder.

Failing to include this form may cause delays and could lead to your shipment being returned to the original pickup location, resulting in extra shipping charges. Fortunately, with My Baggage, you don\u2019t have to worry about these complexities! When you book with us, we automatically generate the necessary customs documentation for you to complete online.Below, we\u2019ve outlined some key points and frequently asked questions regarding customs when shipping to Australia. While we aim to offer guidance, we recommend conducting your own research with Australian customs to ensure you have the most relevant information for your specific situation.Will my shipment to Australia be subject to customs checks?Yes, all international shipments sent to Australia are subject to customs checks. It's essential to include a complete customs form with your shipment.When you book with My Baggage, we simplify the customs process for you. We generate the required customs paperwork automatically, which you can complete conveniently online. Simply log into the \u2018My Orders\u2019 section of our website after your order has been paid for, and complete the required forms. What is the customs processing time for shipments to Australia?The customs processing time for shipments to Australia can vary as each shipment is unique and subject to inspection by Australian customs officials. Several factors influence the processing time, including the nature of your shipment and the accuracy of the customs forms you submit.Typically, if all customs paperwork is completed accurately and no prohibited items are included in your shipment, your items shipped with My Baggage should clear customs without delay. By ensuring your customs forms are filled out correctly, you can help facilitate a smoother and more efficient customs clearance process for your shipment to Australia.As delays are possible, we do not recommend sending time-sensitive items to Australia on this service.What Documentation is required when shipping Personal Effects to Australia?When shipping to Australia, you\u2019ll need several important documents to ensure a smooth customs clearance process. In addition to the customs forms generated by My Baggage, you will also need to provide a copy of the passport's image page of the recipient. In addition, you must complete a B534 form, which will be included with your customs paperwork.To avoid potential issues, it is crucial that all documentation required by customs is in the name of the recipient, who should be the owner of the shipment. If any documents are in the sender's name and differ from the recipient's name, customs may reject the shipment.When sending personal effects, ensure that the names of both the sender and the recipient match those of the shipment's owner.Remember that each shipment is unique, and individual circumstances may vary. As such, Australian customs may request additional documentation to facilitate the clearance of your shipment.Do I have to declare the value of my items that I\u2019m shipping to Australia?When completing your customs forms for your shipment to Australia, it is essential to accurately and clearly declare the value of each item you are sending. This declaration helps demonstrate that your shipment consists of used personal effects, which can facilitate the customs clearance process.To ensure clarity, provide specific details about each item. For example, you might declare:4 x Men\u2019s Used Cotton T-Shirts (Colour: White)1 x Pair of Used Men\u2019s Brown Leather Shoes (Size 8)2 x Dark Blue Used Men\u2019s Denim Jeans (Size Medium)Being thorough and precise in your declarations will help prevent any delays or issues with your shipment at customs.Will I have to pay customs fees when shipping to Australia?Customs fees may apply when shipping to Australia, but this depends on several factors, including the accuracy of the values declared on your customs forms. If customs fees are due, our courier partner will contact you with a detailed breakdown of the charges. You can then pay these fees online or over the phone through our courier partner, who will coordinate with Australian Customs to expedite the clearance process and ensure your shipment is delivered as quickly as possible.When sending gifts to Australia from the USA, shipments valued at up to $1,000 AUD can be sent without incurring customs fees. Generally, low-value shipments of personal effects are exempt from such fees.However, if your gift exceeds $1,000 AUD or if you\u2019re sending multiple gifts with a combined value exceeding this amount, applicable duties and taxes will apply. To avoid unexpected costs, it\u2019s advisable to accurately declare the value of your items on the customs forms.Is there anything else I should consider when shipping to Australia?There are several important factors to consider when shipping to Australia. All shipments are thoroughly inspected by Australian Customs, and items that pose a biosecurity risk, such as food products or wooden items, may be subject to additional scrutiny. This could lead to delays of up to 10 days or more, and additional fees may apply.It is also crucial to ensure that all items being shipped are thoroughly cleaned, as dirt or contaminants can cause complications during customs clearance. For more detailed information, please refer to our 'Preparing Your Shipment to Australia' section below. Taking these precautions can help ensure a smoother shipping experience and minimise potential delays.Preparing your Shipment to AustraliaWhen preparing your shipment to Australia, it\u2019s crucial to review the following information carefully. You must not ship any prohibited items to Australia, as this may lead to delays, returns, or disposal of your shipment. In addition, some items are classified as non-compensation items; while you can still send these, you do so at your own risk.Proper packaging is essential to ensure your belongings arrive safely and in good condition. Pay special attention to any items that may have come into contact with plants or animals outside of Australia, such as bicycles, golf clubs, shoes, or hiking gear. Make sure these items are thoroughly cleaned and packaged appropriately to avoid any complications during customs clearance.Find Out MoreOther Ways Of Getting Your Belongings To AustraliaTransporting your luggage and boxes with My Baggage is just one option for getting your personal belongings to Australia. When relocating, it's essential to consider all available alternatives that align with your requirements. Here are some alternative shipping solutions to explore when sending items to Australia.International Removals to AustraliaIf you and your family are moving to Australia to start a new life and have many possessions to bring - like furniture and numerous personal items - you might want to consider using an international removals company. This way, you can transport all your belongings in one go.Sea Freight to AustraliaIf you don\u2019t have an entire household to ship to Australia but do have a few large items like a sofa, refrigerator, or even a car, you might opt to use cargo ships in large shipping containers. Keep in mind that shipping by sea can be quite slow, and you might be without your belongings for up to two months, depending on the service.While sea freight is generally much more affordable than air freight, you also need to consider the costs of transporting your items to and from the ports, both at departure and upon arrival in Australia. These additional expenses can add up.Air Freight to AustraliaLike sea freight, air freight allows you to ship large and bulky items that might be challenging to transport otherwise. While air freight is much faster than sea freight, it\u2019s usually more expensive because it\u2019s priced by weight and volume. Additionally, you'll need to factor in the costs of transporting your items to and from the airports, just as you would with sea freight.Get a quoteCollect fromUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaC\u00f4te d\u2019IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\u00e9union, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweDeliver toUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaC\u00f4te d\u2019IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarR\u00e9union, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweGet QuoteMy Baggage: Door to Door Shipping ExpertsLuggage ShippingShip your baggage anywhere in the world with us.

Walsh is also furious that no airlines were consulted on the two-week self-isolation rules before plans were made public.The UK government is adamant that the new policy will keep transmission rates of coronavirus down and help prevent a second wave. However, many airlines and holiday firms have argued it will prove hugely damaging to the tourism sector. Meanwhile, industry body Airlines UK has said the quarantine \u201cwould effectively kill off air travel\u201d.British Airways, who had already revealed they will be cutting up to 12,000 jobs, are now burning through their cash reserves at an alarming rate of \u00a31m per hour. The Bank of England have loaned the airline \u00a3300m, the \u201cmaximum amount\u201d available and Mr Walsh insists that every effort has been made to increase the cash balance of the company.Last week, a letter from 200 travel companies was sent to the Home Secretary urging for the quarantine to be amended or removed and argued that travel between countries safe from coronavirus should be permitted, without the need for self-isolation.The government is understood to be considering air bridges with several major European destinations including Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore.

You may choose to do so because you are relocating overseas, travelling to university or college, going on holiday, or taking an extended trip, such as a gap year.Many of our customers are moving abroad and need to ship personal effects, like clothes, books, sports equipment and home furnishings. Gone are the days when hiring a removal van and driving across countries or even continents was the only answer. Gone too are the days when travellers had to rely on freight shipping to get their possessions from A to B. Instead of waiting weeks for freight to arrive, travellers can pack their possessions into suitcases or boxes and have them arrive at their destination within days. By sending their things with Send My Bag, they can instantly create a new home abroad and enjoy the familiarity of their favourite possessions.Send My Bag started off as a student luggage shipping company and we still send thousands of student bags today. Not only do students use our service to help them move to and from university and college at the end of each semester, but they also use us when going on a third year abroad, as part of an Erasmus scheme or a language assistantship.Travellers taking extended trips benefit from having all the things they need with them at their destination without the hassle of transporting it all themselves. Travellers taking a trip involving multiple destinations can send their luggage ahead as they travel, making their journeys much more pleasant. That's why more and more touring musicians and sportsmen and women are turning to our service for its sheer convenience. Our luggage shipping service also allows travellers to use budget airlines without being affected by limited baggage allowances or being faced by excess baggage fees.How Much Does it Cost to Ship Your Luggage?The cost of shipping luggage depends on your collection country and destination country. It is very affordable to ship luggage with Send My Bag. To send a massive 66 lb/ 30 kg suitcase from the USA to the UK you would expect to pay $147 for the Express, 1-2 day, service. To ship between the UK and France, the cost for 30 kg is only \u00a329 on the Standard service. To ship within the UK, you pay as little as \u00a318 for 30 kg. Get your quick quote now!Is it Cheaper to Ship Luggage?Yes, it is often cheaper to ship luggage, especially if you need to transport a lot of luggage. By shipping your luggage you can avoid your airline's excess baggage fees. Emirates, for example, charge a massive $30 for just 1 kg of excess baggage! If travelling with a budget airline, you will have to pay for any baggage you check, which can very quickly add up.If you are moving abroad, you might have considered using a removals company or paying to send your belongings by sea freight. These options can be very expensive. If using a removals company you have to pay a premium to have a van and driver specifically transport your belongings across long distances. If you send your luggage with Send My Bag, your items will travel on an extremely efficient network that uses delivery vans and drivers available across the globe. Inevitably, the cost to you will be much lower!If you choose sea freight, you may get a good enough deal, but you will have to wait weeks for your items to arrive at port, and then will have to work out how to get your items to your final destination. You may also have to pay an agent to get your items through customs. At Send My Bag we deliver door to door and we advise you on customs every step of the way.Why Ship Luggage?There are many reasons for using a luggage shipping service, but the benefits are clear:Have all your personal belongings at your destination, where you need themBring much more with you than you could check into an airplane holdBring more than you could conceivably drag onto public transportGet to travel luggage freeSkip check-in queuesAvoid long waits at baggage carouselsSave yourself airline baggage feesAvoid expensive excess baggage feesUse public transport freelyEnjoy a stress-free journeyChoosing a Door-to-Door Luggage ServiceIt\u2019s easy to choose a luggage shipping service \u2013 just go for one that won\u2019t be beaten on price and that guarantees express service items will arrive on time or your money back!Send My Bag has a proven track record of getting luggage to its destination on time and in tact!

Find out how much it would cost to check your bags with your airline, taking into account the cost of going over your baggage allowance.If travelling with a budget airline like Ryanair, you may find that the cost of your flight increases dramatically once you have included all those basic 'extras' that such airlines like to charge for. Ryanair are now charging to bring anything more than a small handbag on board their planes, so it pays to do your research.Aside from saving money, by sending your bags ahead you also get the luxury of luggage-free travel, which means you don't have to fork out for a taxi to transport all your luggage or struggle to drag multiple suitcases onto public transport.Shipping Luggage Around the WorldSend My Bag has 1000s of routes all over the world, to over 165 destinations, from the UK, the US, Australia, Africa, South America and many others.

Search articles and guides Search for Search Flying Air France carry-on bag size: Everything you need to know 6 min read Fie Kornum, Blane Bachelor February 24, 2025 Air France has similar carry-on policies to other major carriers based in Europe. All passengers are allowed one piece of carry-on luggage and a personal item. However, there are some important differences from US carriers. Here\u2019s what else to know about Air France carry on size and other key intel. Find Air France flights Air France carry-on size: The basics Air France refers to carry-on bags as hand baggage. All Economy passengers are allowed one piece of hand baggage and one personal item. Passengers traveling in Premium, Business, or La Premi\u00e8re cabins are allowed two hand baggage items and one personal item. Carry-on bagPersonal itemMax dimensions21.7 x 13.8 x 9.9 in11.8 x 15.7 x 5.8 inMax weight Economy and Premium cabin26.4 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)26.4 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)Max weight in the Business cabin or in La Premi\u00e8re40 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item)40 lb (combined weight for carry-on bag and personal item) The combined weight limit is significantly lower than most limits for major airlines in the US and can catch passengers by surprise. Air France does not count items such as jackets or duty free shopping bags toward its hand bag allowance, which is helpful. Air France carry-on rules for traveling with infants Fortunately, Air France has fairly generous carry-on policies for parents or caregivers traveling with little ones. But it\u2019s still helpful to familiarize yourself with the rules ahead of time. If your child is traveling on your lap (which is allowed until they are two years old), you may bring one piece of hand baggage. A stroller will count toward this allowance; see below for more info. However, you can also check a stroller and a car seat as hold luggage for no extra charge. This is a nice extra for parents who want to use these items during their trip but don\u2019t need them during transit. If your child has their own seat, they have the same carry-on allowances as adult passengers, depending on the ticket fare category. Are strollers allowed as carry-on bags on Air France? Depending on space availability and the aircraft, some strollers may be accepted in the cabin. Depending on the type of stroller, the following size limits apply: Small foldable stroller: dimensions cannot exceed 5.9 x 11.8 x 39.4 in Other foldable strollers: These count toward your child's hand baggage allowance. Once folded, the stroller cannot exceed 21.7 x 13.8 x 9.8 in. If you\u2019re traveling on an Air France partner from the US (such as Delta) and connecting to an Air France flight elsewhere (Europe, for example), the carriers\u2019 differing carry-on policies can be confusing. Delta does not specify a weight limit for carry-on luggage, while Air France does (and it\u2019s only 26.4 pounds). This means that your carry-on baggage might be fine for the Delta leg, but over the limit for the Air France one. It may not be an issue, but it\u2019s helpful to keep in mind \u2013 and an incentive to pack light.What extra items can you bring on board Air France flights? Fortunately, Air France allows passengers to bring extra items on board that do not count toward your hand bag allowance. The following items are neither considered a personal item nor hand baggage: A jacket, coat, or any other clothing item you may be wearing An umbrella Duty-free items purchased on board or at the airport Children\u2019s items, such as strollers What are the carry-on rules for musical instruments on Air France? Musical instruments smaller than 45 in (115 cm) in total dimensions are considered a standard hand baggage item and are included in your baggage allowance. However, keep in mind that your only other allowed item will be a personal item that fits under the seat in front of you. Musical instruments larger than the above dimensions require approval from Air France at least 48 hours prior to your flight\u2019s departure. In this case, instruments will be placed not in overhead buts but on one or more additional seats (the fare for which the passenger is required to pay).Air France carry-on FAQs Still have questions about Air France carry on bag size or other concerns? Read on for expert answers. How strict is Air France about carry-on size? It depends on several factors: how full the flight is; the discretion of gate agents; and a passenger\u2019s status with the airline. Some passengers have reported that Air France conducts weight checks in its hub of Charles de Gaulle (CDG) prior to departure. As a result, it\u2019s highly recommended for passengers to be familiar with the rules \u2013 and understand the risks (a fee to check an oversized or overweight bag) if you\u2019re tempted to bring on more than the allowance. Can I bring a backpack and a purse on Air France? Yes, assuming that both fall within Air France carry-on size dimensions. Top three Air France carry-on luggage tips from expert traveler Blane Bachelor Tip #1: Use overhead bin space wisely I appreciate that Air France doesn\u2019t count items like duty free shopping bags and jackets toward hand baggage allowance. That said, please don\u2019t abuse the privilege \u2013 and always wait to see if there\u2019s enough overhead bin space before you stuff in your jacket or shopping bags. Tip #2: Expect carry-ons to be checked on full flights As with other major carriers, passengers on Air France\u2019s lowest fare category \u2013 Economy Light \u2013 are allowed two carry-on items. However, if the flight is full, these passengers\u2019 hand bags will be the first in line to be checked, fortunately, for free (unless they\u2019re oversized or overweight, in which case, you may be charged). Tip #3: Be prepared for carry-on weight checks I personally have never had my carry-on bags weighed on an Air France flight (knock wood). But I\u2019ve heard plenty of other passengers have, most often at Charles de Gaulle. Since Delta Air Lines, an Air France partner airline, has a higher carry-on weight allowance, this can be tricky to navigate for international connections. But it\u2019s definitely something to be aware of so it doesn\u2019t come as an unpleasant surprise during your trip. Still have questions about Air France carry-on size? Luggage policies can be confusing. For an easy way to compare carry-on rules across airlines, check out our carry-on luggage guide. Need help deciding between a carry-on or checked bag? Or perhaps you\u2019re stuck on what to pack? We have plenty of handy tips for that, too. Finally, don\u2019t forget to check what\u2019s allowed in a carry-on before you head to the airport. How was this guide created? Carry-on policies can be tricky, and, let's face it, pretty dry. We get it: That\u2019s why we team up with travel experts, decipher the details, and create guides designed to make travel planning easier.

Personal Effects Customs Clearance AustraliaImportant InformationShipping from the UKCustomers shipping to Australia from the UK may only send 1 bag or box per order with a declared value of up to $1000 AUD. You can however place multiple orders should you need to send more than one item.Shipping to Australia from countries other than the UKYou may ship more than one piece per order when shipping to Australia from countries other than the UK, however shipments with a declared value over $1000 AUD may attract a c. $100 formal clearance fee from Australian customs. The declared value is your estimated pre-owned resale value of the contents for customs purposes, it is not a replacement value for insurance purposes, in our experience a suitcase of used clothes is likely to carry a resale value of less than $200 AUD. Sending a larger shipment? Australia customs will typically expect a shipment of over 100kgs to have a declared customs value of over $1000 AUD, as such if sending more than 100kgs you may want to split the shipment across more than one order, or to ensure the declared value is over $1000 AUD and bear in mind it is likely the $100 formal clearance fee will be billed to you.Quarantine / BiosecurityAustralia has a strict Biosecurity System and shipments containing items such as foodstuffs, wooden products or items which have been contact with plants or animals may be selected for quarantine by Australia Border Force. Shipments sent to Australia by any means, including post, courier or freight are subject to the same rules. We currently find around 20 in every 1000 shipments sent by Send My Bag customers are selected for quarantine. While the decision to quarantine is taken by Australia Border Force agents and is outside of our control, tips to help avoid quarantine include:- If sending items such as hiking boots, sports equipment or tools that have been in contact with soil, plants or animals, ensure they are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, include this information on your packing list.- Label items clearly on your packing list, if a description is vague and border force is unsure what something is they may quarantine your shipment as a precaution. Examples of shipments which have been quarantined include; - A horse saddle; as this is an item directly associated with use with animals, it is likely this item would always be quarantined, even if it has been labelled as cleaned.- A shipment containing some makeup items but one item was listed on the packing list as \"powder\". This description was too vague and it was quarantined as a precaution. If more detail had been provided, e.g. \"cosmetic blusher powder\" border force may have taken a different decision.If your item is quarantined it will be held by border force for several weeks and you will be required to pay a quarantine fee of c. A$120 directly to our agent in Australia before border force will release it for onward delivery.

General Personal Effects Customs InformationPersonal effects are typically defined as used items which have been in the sender's possession for 6 months or more. If your shipment is checked by customs and is found to contain brand new or commercial items, you shipment may not be assessed as personal effects. Keep this in mind if you are sending Christmas gifts or other new items. Please check with customs so you are aware of potential customs duties, follow any advice given and attach all necessary documentation.In order to demonstrate that your shipment consists of personal effects, you will be required to complete a brief non-generic packing list online, entries to be made in the format: \"5 x Cotton Dresses, 2 x Jeans, 3 x Pair of Gloves\", and so on, rather than as \"10 x Used Clothing\".As customs processes and allowances vary by country, we advise all customers take 5 minutes to check how their personal circumstances and what they are sending will be assessed under the prevailing customs regulations of the destination.More information is available on our customs information page. Customs Clearance TimeOver 95% of shipments on this route will not be stopped by customs, however, when a bag is stopped by customs for any reason (missing documentation, impromptu inspection, prohibited contents, commercial contents or further information required) Send My Bag records how long customs hold it for. Our historical statistics for this route indicate shipments stopped for any reason other than quarantine inspection typically are released within one working day once any query has been resolved e.g. missing paperwork. Shipments that require quarantine clearance by Australian Border Force will typically be held for up to 10 working days before they are approved for import and released. Shipping Gifts to AustraliaAustralia allows gifts up to a value of $1000 AUD to enter the country tax and duty free. Where multiple gifts are sent for different people and the total value exceeds $1000 AUD, duty and tax will become applicable. Australian customs does not allow items within a consignment to be split for the purposes of tax and duty calculation, if sending gifts valued over $1000 AUD you could consider sending them as separate shipments.All shipments, regardless of gift status, are subject to inspection by Australian Border Force.

About Australia Australia - also known as OZ, or the Land Down Under - is a popular holiday and emigration destination, with most regions enjoying pleasant temperatures throughout the year. The sheer expanse of the country makes it a wonderful and intriguing country to visit. It\u2019s the sixth largest country on the planet and includes the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. Australia is made up of a range of landscapes, from mountains to deserts, reefs, forests, beaches, and cosmopolitan cities. If you\u2019re looking for an adventure holiday or if you plan to start a new life for you and your family, Australia really is the place to go. As you may know, Australia\u2019s summer ranges from December to February, hence Christmas BBQs on the beach. This means that winter falls between June and August with cooler temperatures. However, as Australia is so big, the country covers a number of climate zones with some places much cooler than others.Some of the top activities and must-see sites in Australia include snorkelling or diving round the Great Barrier Reef, taking a trip to Uluru and exploring the Blue Mountains National Park. It\u2019s a great place to go trekking, mountain climbing, or to enjoy extreme sports. If you like to take it much, much easier, then Australia has some of the best beaches in the world. Why not spend the day at Bondi Beach, one of the most famous beaches there is. A bit further afield is Christmas Island which offers the perfect escape on its pristine beaches.If you prefer a cosmopolitan holiday, Australia\u2019s vibrant and lively cities make a brilliant destination. The capital, Canberra, is the largest landlocked city and offers a unique insight into Australian life. Influenced by garden cities, buildings are intermixed with parks and gardens. The larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne are the more popular destinations for tourists and those looking to emigrate. Sydney, of course, has its Opera House and is the site of the first British Colony in Australia, and is thus steeped in colonial history. Melbourne is in the state of Victoria. It is a fantastic cultural city filled with museums and galleries, and is home to a number of festivals. Please explore this page further to find out about Send My Bag\u2019s shipping service to Australia. Other Ways of Shipping to Australia As well as sending parcels, baggage and luggage to Australia you could investigate the following options for shipping items internationally, especially if you need to send large, bulky items like pieces of furniture. Air Freight to AustraliaAir freight is one way you could send items, such as a table or armchair, to Australia. Sending items by air freight usually takes one to two days, which is usually faster than sea freight shipping, but typically more expensive. The amount you will be required to pay will depend on the weight and size of your shipment. You will likely also have to use the services of a customs agent to handle customs clearance for you. And, you will need to arrange how to get your items to and from the airport. Costs could, therefore, quickly mount up. If you send internationally by air freight to Australia your items would likely arrive at one of the major airports, such as Sydney Airport or Melbourne Airport.Sea Freight and Container Shipping to AustraliaYou could choose sea freight rather than air freight to transport your possessions to Australia. This is an option if you don\u2019t need to receive your items immediately. Again, this option is usually used when shipping large bulky items, such as a sofa or even a car. Sea freight usually means shipping items in large containers loaded onto cargo ships. It can be cheaper than air freight, but you will still need to use the services of a customs agent and will need to sort out how to get your items to and from the ports. So, the cost could end up being more than you first expected. When using container shipping to Australia your items will most likely arrive by ship at one of the major sea ports, such as the Port of Brisbane or the Port of Melbourne.Shipping Goods to AustraliaWhen shipping goods to Australia you need to be aware of the current customs rules. You should be aware of any duty that you need to pay and what items are allowed to be shipped to Australia, which items are restricted, and which are entirely prohibited. Take a look at the prohibited items and customs sections on this page for more information.

Kalitta Air began service in November 2000 with three Boeing 747 aircraft and the fleet has grown to a present total of 22 B747-400 freighters, and 5 B777 freighters and with 4 on CMI.Capable of air express delivery of virtually any type of freight, the company provides scheduled or on-demand charter service for customers in the United States and around the world. Mr. Kalitta was honored as the 2018 recipient of the prestigious Ronald N. Priddy NACA-CRAF Partners in Airlift Medal (\u201cPriddy Medal\u201d) presented by the National Air Carrier Association. Most recently Mr. Kalitta was enshrined into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame in April 2019.Kalitta has a lifetime of experience in the airline industry that goes back to 1967 when he began transporting parts for the automotive business with a twin engine Cessna 310 that he piloted himself. Over the years, Kalitta grew from a one airplane operation into a substantial airline conglomerate, American International Airways, Inc. (AIA), that used B747, L1011, DC8, B727, DC9, Twin Beech and Learjet aircraft in worldwide airfreight, air ambulance and charter passenger operations. AIA supported the Desert Shield/Desert Storm operations with award winning efforts. AIA was one of the world's 25 largest airlines with revenues in excess of $400 million derived from both scheduled and on-demand air charters as well as third party engine and airframe maintenance service.In 1997, AIA merged with Kitty Hawk, Inc. and Kalitta resigned from the company and the Board of Directors to pursue other interests, mainly to start another company -- Kalitta Leasing. Kalitta Leasing is an aircraft brokerage company that buys, sells and leases large aircraft. By April 2000 Kitty Hawk International (the former AIA) ceased operations and filed Chapter 11. Dismayed that the airline he built from scratch was shut down, Kalitta fought to purchase the Aircraft Certificate and resurrect the airline. Kalitta Air received its DOT and FAA authority to begin operations in November 2000 and immediately began revenue service.Kalitta quickly obtained the necessary approvals from the government and secured contracts with the USPS and the DOD. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, when airports were closed and all flights were grounded, there was one plane in the sky that night that was not an F-16 fighter. It was a Kalitta Air 747 hauling relief supplies from the West coast to aid disaster workers. In 2003 Kalitta was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation for support of the Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom Operations and Kalitta continues to support the USPS with scheduled flights delivering mail and packages to the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.In addition to resurrecting the airline, Kalitta has also revived the aircraft maintenance facility in Oscoda, Michigan which was once the home of the old Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The FAA recently presented Kalitta Air with The Diamond Award which is the FAA\u2019s highest honor for maintenance training. Utilizing most of the airport and several hangars, over 1,500+ employees work around the clock to maintain the aircraft.Kalitta a legend not only in the aviation world but also the Motorsports world, but most-specifically in the National Hot Rod Association world of drag racing. He is one of the most successful professional drag racers and crew chiefs in NHRA\u2019s Top Fuel class - ever. Driving a Top Fuel dragster adorned with \u201cThe Bounty Hunter\u201d livery, Kalitta was a threat to win every time he eased up to the starting line. Kalitta won three drag racing championships during his driving career, and in fact, it was his winnings in drag racing that enabled him to purchase the Cessna 310 that he used to start his airline business.\u200dKalitta was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in June of 1992 for his tremendous contribution to the sport. He held the world speed record on multiple occasions during his driving career, and although no longer in the driver\u2019s seat, he owns two NHRA Top Fuel Dragster teams and one NHRA Funny Car team. He is a five-time NHRA World Championship team owner taking titles in 1994, \u201995, 2015, \u201918 and \u201823. In 2016 Kalitta was the recipient of the first-ever NHRA Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2017, he was presented with an award by the British Drag Racing Hall of Fame recognizing him for operating one of the most successful Top Fuel and Funny Car teams in NHRA history over a period of six decades.\u200dThree championship drivers currently compete under the Kalitta Motorsports banner: Doug Kalitta, 2023 NHRA Top Fuel champion and nephew of the team owner, 2013 NHRA Top Fuel champion Shawn Langdon and 2018 NHRA Funny Car champion J.R.

However, for domestic travel, or travel within the EU, customs is not usually required. In all cases, you will pass through security checks, to which it\u2019s likely your ID and Documents will be checked, so it\u2019s a good idea to have these documents ready and available throughout your journey.Entry requirements vary from country to country. It\u2019s very important that you research the exact requirements specific to you before you travel, as certain countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, and possibly bank statements. Your passport must also be valid for the full duration of your stay, with some countries requiring at least 6 months validity. However, all requirements will differ and are subject to your specific circumstances, such as duration of stay, purpose of travel, and the regulations that the country has set.We recommend sourcing information about entry requirements from the country\u2019s official websites.Connecting FlightsConnecting flights refer to you taking multiple flights in order to reach your destination. This results in having a longer journey time, however, it\u2019s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not. This is why more and more travellers are travelling light by shipping their luggage ahead.Many low-cost airlines don't offer connecting flights. This means it's your responsibility to manage your onward connections, and collect your baggage after each flight.If you\u2019re unsure, we recommend that you contact your airline directly.\u26d4 Avoid Airline Baggage Fees \u26a0\ufe0fShip your luggage with My Baggage and avoid large airline baggage fees.TrustpilotAdding additional baggage to your flight or incurring excess baggage fees at the airport can considerably increase the overall cost of travel.Thankfully, My Baggage offers a convenient and cost-effective luggage shipping service that allows you to ship a massive 30KG/66lbs per suitcase at fantastic low rates.

Check prices and book 4.7/5 average from 132,000 reviews Travelling abroad can be a stressful time; not only do you need to remember all the tickets, passports and documents you need simply to travel, you frequently also have to deal with lengthy baggage check-in lines, long waits at the luggage collection carousels and the possibility of your bags going missing in transit. On top of all this, airlines are also now ramping up the costs of any excess luggage you want to take with you on your trip as well as shrinking the weight allowances you can take. This means that not only do the oversized luggage pieces including golf clubs, skis and surf boards cost you extra, but a bag that\u2019s slightly heavier than usual containing hiking boots, overweight books or just lots of bulky clothing can be slapped with a fee too.This is where Send My Bag\u2122 can come to the rescue - being able to ship your outsized luggage and heavy bags worldwide at great value, saving you not only on costs, but also on hassle. No destination around the world is too far for us to deliver your boxes and bags, whether you need shipping to Italy for a year studying abroad, as far afield as Cambodia or New Zealand for a Gap Year, or you even just have an overweight bag for your quick holiday break to France.If you\u2019re taking an extended trip in America or Europe -travelling around, seeing the sights and getting a taste of the local culture - you\u2019ll quite likely need to take a variety of different clothing with you in order to brave the seasons. For example, arriving in Spain in September will mean you need your sunhats, swimwear and shorts, but heading into Austria in late November will see mountains of snow that you\u2019ll need to be protected against with bulky winter coats, gloves and woolly hats. Packing all of that into one suitcase to travel with clearly isn\u2019t going to be an easy feat, but by using SendMyBag, you can take as many excess bags and boxes as you are able to pick up at your destination, whether you need ski boots and skis, or surfboards and sunglasses.It\u2019s a very simple process to get your luggage booked in for a collection from your home to take it directly to your destination, whether that\u2019s within the EU or half way around the world. All you need to do is ensure that you\u2019ve got the customs forms filled in that we\u2019ll provide you with and that you have everything packed up ready for collection, complete with our labels, to ensure a quick and smooth process.Wondering what your standard airline baggage allowance is?

Connections between interline partner carriers must be made between 4 hours and the minimum connection time (varies), else it is considered a stopover and you will need to collect your bags and check back in. If you have a separate confirmation code for a connecting flight, please check in with an airport agent at your point of origin. Beginning June 1, 2012, Hawaiian will not through check bags to other airline flights unless the other airline segments are on the same itinerary for which the passenger is checking in. Exemptions from bag fees related to frequent flyer status on partner airlines may not apply when checking in on Hawaiian.

This means they don't have to either check their larger cabin bag into the hold, nor travel with a small personal item only.

'Priority & 2 Cabin Bags' costs between \u00a36 and \u00a336 per person, one way.What If My Cabin Bag Is Overweight/ Oversized?If an item of cabin luggage exceeds the dimensions or weight permitted by Ryanair\u2019s baggage allowance, it will be placed in the hold and a charge of \u20ac/\u00a370-75 (plus VAT) will be levied.Ryanair Hand Luggage Allowance for Toiletries and Make upRyanair allows passengers to pack toiletries and make up into their hand luggage provided all liquids are in containers of no more than 100 ml.

In addition, customers choosing to pre-pay for a 10 kg checked bag must now pay \u00a310, rather than \u00a38. 01/11/2018: Ryanair's New Baggage Policy Comes Into EffectNow the only free hand luggage allowed on board Ryanair flights is one small personal item; 40 x 25 x 20 cm.29/09/2018: Ryanair Makes \u00a31.7 Billion from Add-On ChargesA new report has revealed that Ryanair has earned over \u00a31.7 billion in just one year from ancillary revenue, placing the airline among the top 5 airlines for this type of income.21/09/2018: Antitrust Investigates New Ryanair Baggage FeesItaly's competition watchdog, Antittrust, is investigating Ryanair's new hand luggage fees. The watchdog dislikes the fact that customers must pay \u20ac6 (\u00a35) in order to bring a small suitcase on board as hand luggage.24/08/2018: Ryanair Reduces Free Cabin Baggage AllowanceFrom 1st November, 2018 Ryanair passengers will have to pay \u00a38 to check a small 10 kg suitcase into the hold or \u00a36 for Priority Boarding, which allows them to bring their suitcase on board.20/11/2017: Ryanair Flights for Under a TennerRyanair are offering Black Friday deals on flights, with some going for as little as \u00a39.99. These flights are to be taken in December this year, but there are likely to be more deals popping up in the next few days. Why not grab one of these deals and avoid Ryanair's baggage fees by shipping your luggage to your destination with Send My Bag?25/10/2017: Ryanair New Cabin Baggage Policy PostponedThe new Ryanair cabin baggage policy, which states that any passengers without Priority Boarding will have their larger item of hand luggage placed in the hold, has now been postponed until 15th January, 2018 to allow passengers to get used to the idea.27/09/2017: Ryanair Travel Chaos to Continue for MonthsFollowing the disruption caused by Ryanair incorrectly scheduling staff holidays, the airline has now announced that it is suspending 34 routes over the winter period, including Newcastle to Faro and London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow.25/09/2017: No Insurance Pay-Outs for Many Ryanair PassengersAlthough Ryanair has offered limited compensation to those passengers affected by its cancelled flights, holidaymakers are unlikely to be reimbursed for any other aspects of their holiday they have missed out on. This is because most basic holiday insurance packages do not cover loss as a result of cancelled flights.18/09/2017: Flight Misery for Ryanair PassengersRyanair has cancelled approximately 2000 flights, leaving 315,000 passengers either stranded abroad, stuck at home and missing their holidays, or forking out hundreds of pounds to make other arrangements. This is a result of a blunder over the scheduling of pilot holidays.The knock-on effect of this scheduling error is likely to be enormous, especially for passengers among the 50 million people every year who choose to travel on self-connected flights. At the best of times these passengers have to do all the leg-work themselves when it comes to checking, reclaiming and rechecking their baggage onto different flights. If their Ryanair flights are cancelled, they will encounter all manner of difficulty trying to reorganise their itineraries, and all with a pile of baggage in tow.06/09/2017: Only Small Handbag is Guaranteed Hand LuggageNew Ryanair baggage rules mean that, unless passengers pay \u00a35 for Priority Boarding, they will be forced to place their larger item of cabin baggage into the hold once they arrive at the boarding gate. This means that non-Priority customers will only be able to bring their small personal item on board with them.This is likely to cause problems for passengers who are unaware of the new policy and who have not prepared their hand baggage for the stresses and strains of being loaded into and out of the hold. Damaged hand luggage will likely become a common occurrence on Ryanair flights. There is now all the more reason to send your luggage to your destination and avoid altogether the hassle of flying with luggage.Ryanair News22/09/2020: Ryanair Warns of Potential Winter Base ClosuresAn internal memo seen by Ryanair pilots and crew has warned of possible base closures at Cork and Shannon in the winter season.17/08/2020: Ryanair Cuts Flights After Increase in EU Virus RatesFollowing the reintroduction of quarantine measures in the UK and Ireland for arrivals from several EU countries, Ryanair announce they will cut 20% of their flying capacity in September and October.07/08/2020: Ryanair Restores 60% of Flights in AugustRyanair announces it has restored 60% of its normal flight schedule in August.28/07/2020: Ryanair Still Flying to SpainBudget EU airline Ryanair will continue flights in and out of Spain as normal, despite the reintroduction of a 14-day quarantine on arrivals from the country into the UK.02/07/2020: Welsh Government Asks Ryanair to Stop FlightsRyanair flights departing Cardiff Airport are due to go ahead despite the travel guidance in Wales asking citizens to remain with 5 miles of their homes.

You can find out more here.Essentials for your Upcoming FlightMy Baggage is your one-stop shop for all your travel needs, from suitcases to adapters and AirTags. We have everything you need for your upcoming flight.Cabin SuitcaseBuy NowSuitcase TravelsetBuy NowTravel AdapterBuy NowApple AirTagsBuy NowAmerican Airlines Checked BaggageOn domestic, transatlantic and transpacific routes, passengers can check up to ten bags per person. Passengers can check up to 5 bags if they are travelling to, through or from Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America and Brazil \u2013 however, it should be noted that there are seasonal and year-round baggage restrictions on these routes (please visit the American Airlines website for more information on these restrictions). On domestic flights, Economy passengers may check one piece of baggage for $30. For a second piece the charge is $40, the third is $150 and any additional baggage is charged at $200. On transatlantic flights, Economy passengers are permitted to check one piece of baggage at no charge. Should passengers need to book any additional checked baggage, there is a charge of $100 for the first additional piece and $200 for any additional pieces. In some cases, you won\u2019t have to pay the baggage fees for up to 3 bags if you are eligible. Please visit the American Airlines website for more information on this. For all regions, checked baggage must not exceed the total dimensions of 158cm, and must not exceed 23kg in weight. However, for First and Business Class customers, checked baggage must not exceed 32kg. Fees apply to oversize/overweight baggage.American Airlines Excess BaggageIf your checked bag exceeds the weight allowance of 23kg or exceeds the total size restriction of 158cm, excess baggage charges will be applied depending on your route. It should be noted that these fees are non-refundable, applied per person and each way. For more detail on these charges, please visit the American Airlines website directly. First and Business Class, Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald members can check baggage up to 32kg at no additional cost. However, please note American Airlines do not accept any checked baggage over 320cm in total dimensions, or over 45kg in total weight.American Airlines Exceptional BaggageSpecial restrictions, exceptions and charges can apply when you\u2019re travelling with exceptional baggage such as sports equipment or a musical instrument. Restrictions and charges are variable according to the particular item and route travelled. For example, if you are taking golf clubs with you, you can travel with 1 golf bag containing: golf clubs, golf balls, golf tees, 1 pair of golf shoes. You can\u2019t travel with swingless golf club load strips. Standard checked bag fees of your destination apply up to 50 lb / 23 kg and 126 in / 320 cm (length + width + height) or $150 fee applies from 51 lb / 23 kg \u2013 70 lb / 32 kg. If you are travelling with a small musical instrument, this can be your carry on item on a first-come, first-serve basis as long as it fits in the overhead bin or fits under the seat in front of you. If they are too large to be carried in the cabin, they can be checked into your hold luggage. The maximum size is 381cm with a maximum weight of 75kg.CONTACT AIRLINECustoms & Entry RequirementsWhen travelling internationally, it\u2019s a requirement that you pass through customs. However, for domestic travel, or travel within the EU, customs is not usually required. In all cases, you will pass through security checks, to which it\u2019s likely your ID and Documents will be checked, so it\u2019s a good idea to have these documents ready and available throughout your journey.Entry requirements vary from country to country. It\u2019s very important that you research the exact requirements specific to you before you travel, as certain countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, and possibly bank statements. Your passport must also be valid for the full duration of your stay, with some countries requiring at least 6 months validity. However, all requirements will differ and are subject to your specific circumstances, such as duration of stay, purpose of travel, and the regulations that the country has set.We recommend sourcing information about entry requirements from the country\u2019s official websites.Connecting FlightsConnecting flights refer to you taking multiple flights in order to reach your destination. This results in having a longer journey time, however, it\u2019s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not. This is why more and more travellers are travelling light by shipping their luggage ahead.Many low-cost airlines don't offer connecting flights. This means it's your responsibility to manage your onward connections, and collect your baggage after each flight.If you\u2019re unsure, we recommend that you contact your airline directly.\u26d4 Avoid Airline Baggage Fees \u26a0\ufe0fShip your luggage with My Baggage and avoid large airline baggage fees.TrustpilotAdding additional baggage to your flight or incurring excess baggage fees at the airport can considerably increase the overall cost of travel.Thankfully, My Baggage offers a convenient and cost-effective luggage shipping service that allows you to ship a massive 30KG/66lbs per suitcase at fantastic low rates.

It can be a maximum size of 45 x 36 x 20 cm (including any handles and wheels) and must be kept under the seat in front of you. Your bag can weigh up to 15kg, but we do ask that you\u2019re able to lift and carry it yourself. If you\u2019d also like to bring a large cabin bag on board (max. 56 x 45 x 25 cm, including any handles and wheels), you have the option to book a large cabin bag for your flight. Every customer who books a large cabin bag can also enjoy the benefit of Speedy Boarding. If you\u2019re an easyJet Plus member or customer who has booked an Inclusive Plus fare, you can also bring a large cabin bag on board (in addition to your small cabin bag) as part of your membership or fare benefits. See below for full details. Please note that the maximum number of cabin bags available per person is two; one small cabin bag for all customers and one large cabin bag for customers if it\u2019s included with their fare or membership benefits or where they have paid to add one to their booking. Remember - purchasing all your bags online is cheaper and will help you avoid paying bag fees at the airport and your cabin bags being placed in the hold. Cabin bags explained This video explains our cabin bag policy, including which bags you can bring on board, how big they can be, and where they need to fit. Please make sure you check your cabin bag allowance before you travel to avoid any unexpected charges. Cabin bag allowances: All customers can bring on board: One small cabin bag Maximum size 45 x 36 x 20cm (including any handles and wheels) Includes items like a small trolley case, handbag, rucksack and laptop bag, but please check dimensions Needs to fit under the seat in front of you Maximum weight 15kg. You need to be able to lift and carry the bag yourself Customers who have paid to add a large cabin bag to their booking or have easyJet Plus membership and have booked a large cabin bag can also bring on board: One large cabin bag Maximum size 56 x 45 x 25 cm (including any handles and wheels) Includes items like a trolley case and larger rucksack, but please check dimensions Needs to fit in an overhead locker Maximum weight 15kg. You need to be able to lift and carry the bag yourself Includes Speedy Boarding (be one of the first to board) Customers with easyJet Plus membership who have not added a large cabin bag, or who are travelling on a Inclusive Plus fare can also bring a large cabin bag on board, subject to available space. If there is no space available we will place the bag in the hold. Your cabin bag allowance - All customers Seat/bag booked Small under seat cabin bag Large cabin bag No seat selection Standard seat Up Front or Extra Legroom seat Large cabin bag added to your booking Inclusive Plus easyJet Plus If you choose not to select a seat when you book, our system will automatically allocate your seat when you check in and will aim to seat you next to others on your booking. Please be aware that if you\u2019re auto-allocated an Up Front or Extra Legroom seat, your cabin bag allowance will be one small under seat cabin bag. Check your cabin bag size We check cabin bag sizes before you board. If your cabin bag is bigger than the maximum size allowed or if you bring a large cabin bag to the departure gate without the correct seat selection or without one pre-booked for your flight, it won\u2019t be able to go in the cabin. We\u2019ll have to check it into the aircraft hold and charges will apply. So it\u2019s important to check your cabin bag allowance before you travel to avoid any unexpected charges. See the bags table on our Fees and Charges page for full details. If you\u2019re unsure whether your cabin bag fits within our maximum dimensions, you can use our handy bag sizing tool on our app (iOS only). Simply open the app and click on your trip itinerary to find the bag sizing tool. You can then use your mobile phone camera to size your cabin bag. If it fits inside the maximum cabin bag dimensions for the bag type you\u2019ve selected, you\u2019re good to go. However, the bag sizing tool should only be used as a guide, the best way to know if your bag will fit is by measuring it with a tape measure (the old school way) before travel. If it doesn\u2019t fit, don\u2019t worry! You can always change your seat or hold luggage quickly and easily through our app or within Manage Bookings. How you can bring a large cabin bag on board When you book a flight with us, you\u2019ll be offered the option to choose a fare which includes a large cabin bag or you can add one to your booking separately. Any fare or cabin bag booking that enables you to bring a large cabin bag on board also entitles you to Speedy Boarding, so you can be one of the first to board. Fare and cabin bag options can be selected at the time of booking, or via Manage Bookings, or on our app, even if you have checked in. You can also do this by contacting our Customer Services Team, but a small additional admin fee may apply if you ask them to do it for you. Please note that availability and prices may vary per flight, depending on when you book, and large cabin bag options may not always be available for your flight. We recommend that where possible you select fares or bags when making your booking to ensure the best availability. If you\u2019re an easyJet Plus member who has added a large cabin bag to your booking you can bring a large cabin bag on board in addition to your small cabin bag. If you are an easyJet Plus member who has not added a large cabin bag, or you are travelling with a Inclusive Plus fare, you can also bring a large cabin bag, subject to available space on board. easyJet Plus members and Inclusive Plus fare customers easyJet Plus members: In addition to your standard cabin bag allowance, as an easyJet Plus member, you can also bring a large cabin bag on board. You can do this free of charge, as one of the benefits of your membership. Add a large cabin bag to your booking and simply enter your easyJet Plus membership number at checkout to get it for free. You can also select an Up Front or Extra Legroom seat free of charge as a benefit of your membership. If you do not book a large cabin bag in advance, your large cabin bag will be subject to available space and if there is no room left on board we will check it into the hold free of charge. Inclusive Plus Fare You can bring on board one large cabin bag in addition to your small cabin bag. Your large cabin bag will be subject to available space on board.

Smart luggage Smart luggage is a bag (suitcase, rucksack or similar) that contains a lithium battery or power bank, which is used to power itself or to recharge other devices. There are restrictions on the type of lithium batteries allowed. Please check here for more information. If the smart luggage is to be checked in and put in the hold, you need to disconnect and remove the lithium battery/power bank from the smart luggage at Bag Drop and take it into the cabin with you. Any exposed terminals should be covered with tape to prevent against short circuits. For safety reasons, the lithium battery/power bank needs to be disconnected, so if you are unable to remove it from your luggage, we won\u2019t be able to accept the bag on board. Handheld belongings You\u2019re allowed to bring some extra things into the cabin. e.g. umbrella, overcoat, crutches, walking stick, one standard bag of goods bought at the airport.

Q3: How do I know how many seats I need to buy for my Seated Baggage?A: Please refer to the images below for a better understanding of the specific placement standards and positions of musical instruments of different sizes.As shown in Image 1, a single cabin seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 40*45*100 cm, and the floor in front of the seat can accommodate baggage of no more than 25*45*140 cm. If any side of the baggage is over the above limit, more seats should be purchased.Case 1: For a violin (including its case) with 18*34*80 cm measurement and a volume within a single seat accommodating range, one seat is enough for the Seated Baggage (Image 2).Case 2: For a cello (including its case) with a measurement of 24*50*134 cm can only be placed on the floor in front of the seat because its longest side is 100 cm larger than the limit. However, its volume exceeds the accommodated baggage volume in front of the seat (25*45*140 cm), so two seats need to be purchased (Image 3).Note: For baggage that needs to be placed on the floor in front of the seat, the limits for the shortest and longest sides of the seat remain unchanged as seat interval and seat height are fixed. When the shortest side exceeds 25 cm, the baggage will not be able to be placed on the cabin floor, and when the longest side exceeds 140 cm, the baggage will not be allowed to enter the cabin as Seated Baggage.The maximum measurement of Seated Baggage in the cabin is 40*60*140 cm, which should occupy three seats.\uff083\uff09Precision instrumentsPrecision instruments refer to high-precision, high-sensitivity equipment and devices used for precise measurement, experimentation, detection, analysis, etc., and should usually be transported as cargo. If they are to be transported as checked baggage, they must be approved by the ground handling agent of Xiamen Airlines. The items should be packed in the original packaging or packaging approved by Xiamen Airlines, should not be included in the free baggage allowance, and should be charged as excess baggage. For such baggage, Xiamen Airlines should be liable for carriage in accordance with the general liability limit for checked baggage. IV. Irregular Carriage of Baggage \uff081\uff09General Provisions1) In the event of any delay, loss, damage or destruction of baggage carriage, the passenger should complete the baggage incident record and go through relevant procedures of Xiamen Airlines or its authorized ground handling agent at the place of the incident;2) If the passenger's checked baggage fails to arrive with the passenger due to any Xiamen Airlines reasons, and fails to be delivered to the passenger on the same day, resulting in inconvenience to passenger's journey life, the passenger can be compensated for temporary daily necessities at the following standard:Passenger classEconomy classBusiness class/Egret PlatinumFirst class/Egret DiamondCompensation for temporary daily necessitiesDomesticRMB 200RMB 300RMB 500InternationalRMB 300 or equivalent foreign currencyRMB 400 or equivalent foreign currencyRMB 500 or equivalent foreign currency\uff082\uff09 Compensation of Baggage1. Xiamen Airlines is not responsible for the destruction, loss, or damage of passengers' luggage caused entirely by the luggage's natural attributes, quality, or defects.2. In the event of damage, destruction, or loss of checked luggage on Xiamen Airlines flights, Xiamen Airlines will compensate or cover repair costs within the luggage compensation limit according to the value of the lost luggage:(1) The compensation liability limit for domestic flights is RMB 100 per kilogram. If the value of the luggage is less than RMB 100 per kilogram, the compensation shall be made according to the actual value.

Passengers bear the burden of proof for the actual value of the loss, but not exceeding the compensation limit applicable under the international convention.3. The weight used to determine Xiamen Airlines' compensation liability limit for the destruction, loss, damage, or delay of checked luggage or any items in the luggage shall only be the actual weight of the damaged luggage or items; if the weight of the damaged luggage or items cannot be determined, the damaged luggage of each passenger can only be calculated based on the free luggage allowance enjoyed by the passenger.4. Important documents and materials, securities, cash, bills, jewelry, precious metals and their products, antiques, calligraphy and painting samples, or other valuable items, fragile or perishable items, prescription medications that need to be taken regularly, medical certificates, travel documents, and other items that require personal care cannot be checked in as luggage or placed inside checked luggage.

If it is found that the passenger has obvious fraudulent behavior, Xiamen Airlines has the right to recover the full compensation.8.

Personal Effects Customs Clearance United StatesIn order for us to request customs grant your personal effects shipment tax & duty free clearance into the USA, after you have placed your order you will be required to log into your account and spend a couple of minutes completing a questionnaire, this will provide Send My Bag with the necessary information to submit a 3299 Personal Effects form to US Customs on your behalf.The owner of the bag will also be required to upload a copy of their passport onto the booking to allow us to declare the consignment as a Personal Effects shipment, which will then make the items eligible for duty exemption.Customer Notice September 2025: US Customs are currently adjusting to significant processing changes rolled out by the US Government on the 29th August 2025.While shipments containing personal belongings are exempt from the changes and should still be cleared tax and duty free, due to confusion surrounding the implementation of the new rules, we are finding around 5% of our shipments to the USA are currently being miscategorised by US Customs with c. $25-100 in associated fees being applied.To avoid delays in the delivery of your shipment (including possible return to origin) if you receive a customs fee invoice, we advise that you pay it as soon as you receive it. Send My Bag cannot pay customs fees on your behalf, even if customs has made a mistake. You should then  us (including a copy of the invoice) and we will dispute it on your behalf. Due to the additional administrative work caused by the customs changes we expect US Customs to take c. 90 days to review and refund. Fees can only be refunded when they are found by US Customs to have been applied incorrectly. If your shipment does not meet the criteria for duty free entry under US Customs' personal effects rules the fees will stand. For example if you are sending commercial goods, since the removal of $800 de minimis threshold there will now always be duties & taxes to pay regardless of the shipping method used.Please note, if you have not correctly identified your shipment as Personal Effects on the form, Send My Bag cannot raise the dispute on your behalf. We can only raise disputes when the form has been completed correctly for duty free entry of personal effects and we believe US Customs has made the mistake. In cases were you may have identified a shipment as commercial but now wish to declare as personal effects, you will need to raise the dispute directly via the contact details on the duty invoice you have received.Country of Origin China & Hong Kong. We believe some shipments are being miscategorised due to customs incorrectly applying rules which relate to commercial shipments originating from China & Hong Kong. When completing your packing list and selecting a country of origin, please select the country in which you purchased and owned the goods. If you bought clothes in the UK, the country of origin for the purposes of shipping them as your own personal belongings is the UK.Glasses, sunglasses and other opticsUS Customs consider sunglasses, glasses, contact lenses and other optics to be medical equipment and will require a Drop Ball Certificate from the optics' manufacturer to permit the items for entry into the US. We recommend you contact your optics' manufacturer prior to shipping to obtain this certificate. If the certificate cannot be obtained, please do not ship the optics as this will result in the entire shipment being returned.Shipments valued over $2500 USDShipments with a declared value over $2500 USD will incur an additional handling fee for formal customs processing of up to $50 USD. General Personal Effects Customs InformationPersonal effects are typically defined as used items which have been in the sender's possession for 6 months or more. If your shipment is checked by customs and is found to contain brand new or commercial items, you shipment may not be assessed as personal effects. Keep this in mind if you are sending Christmas gifts or other new items. Please check with customs so you are aware of potential customs duties, follow any advice given and attach all necessary documentation.In order to demonstrate that your shipment consists of personal effects, you will be required to complete a brief non-generic packing list online, entries to be made in the format: \"5 x Cotton Dresses, 2 x Jeans, 3 x Pair of Gloves\", and so on, rather than as \"10 x Used Clothing\".As customs processes and allowances vary by country, we advise all customers take 5 minutes to check how their personal circumstances and what they are sending will be assessed under the prevailing customs regulations of the destination.More information is available on our customs information page. Shipping Gifts to the United StatesThe US allows a maximum of $100 worth of gifts to be sent to any one person in a single day. For \"Insular Territories\" (US territories that are not 1 of the 50 US states, or the Federal District of Colombia) have an increased allowance of $200 per person.Where gifts are being sent to multiple people within the same packaging, each gift must be individually wrapped and clearly marked with each recipient's name. The $100 allowance applies per person and not per consignment in such instances.If gifts exceed the $100 gift threshold, the tax-free allowance is void and duty/tax will be applied to the entire value of the shipment.US Customs consider sunglasses, glasses, contact lenses and other optics to be medical equipment and will require a Drop Ball Certificate from the optics' manufacturer to permit the items for entry into the US. We recommend you contact your optics' manufacturer prior to shipping to obtain this certificate.

Other Ways of Shipping to the USA As well as sending parcels, baggage and luggage to the USA you could look into the following alternatives for shipping items internationally, especially if you need to send large, bulky items like furniture. Air Freight to the USAYou could send items to the USA by air freight. You might decide to do this if you have large items to transport, such as a table or an armchair. The price you will be charged for this service will depend on the weight and size of your shipment. Sending items by air freight usually takes one to two days and is usually quicker than sea freight shipping, but normally more expensive. However, you will likely have to use the services of a customs agent to handle customs clearance for you. Also, you will need to sort out transportation for your items to and from the airport. You will, therefore, have several different costs to pay if you choose air freight. If you send internationally by air freight to the USA your items would likely arrive at one of the major airports, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport or Los Angeles International Airport.Sea Freight and Container Shipping to the USAYou could ship your possessions to the USA by sea freight rather than air freight, especially if you don\u2019t need to receive them immediately. Sea freight usually means shipping items in containers. With container shipping your items are transported inside a large container on board a cargo ship. You might choose this option if you have very large items to transport internationally, such as furniture or even a car. Sea freight can be cheaper than air freight, but you will need to use the services of a customs agent and will need to sort out how to get your items to and from the ports, with this all adding up in  of cost. When using container shipping to the USA your items will most likely arrive by ship at one of the major sea ports, such as Los Angeles, Long Beach or New Jersey.Shipping Goods to the USAWhen shipping goods to the USA you need to be clued up on the country\u2019s customs rules. You should be aware of any duty that you need to pay and what items are allowed to be shipped to the USA, which items are restricted, and which are entirely prohibited. Take a look at the prohibited items and customs sections on this page for more information. As you will see, items that you are restricted when shipping to the USA include items deriving from certain countries, such as the Sudan, Syria and Cuba.

The fee is \u00a365 GBP, \u20ac75 EUR, $100 USD or $100 CAD per bag per journey. Baggage that is heavier than 32KG will not be accepted.Checked bags that are larger than the standard size but do not exceed 190 x 75 x 65cm, will be considered an oversized bag. It\u2019s recommended that you contact British Airways in advance as an oversized item may require special handling, and you should also aim to have the item checked in at least 90 minutes before your flight.

Although it\u2019s main hub is London Heathrow, BA have a large presence at London Gatwick and London City Airport. The airline offers many cabin classes including World Traveller (Economy), World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy), Club World (Business), and First Class, operating a mixed fleet of Airbus, Boeing and Embraer Jets.Flying Since1919Airline CodeBAMain HubLondon HeathrowFrequent Flyer ProgramExecutive ClubCONTACT AIRLINECustoms & Entry RequirementsWhen travelling internationally, it\u2019s a requirement that you pass through customs. However, for domestic travel, or travel within the EU, customs is not usually required. In all cases, you will pass through security checks, to which it\u2019s likely your ID and Documents will be checked, so it\u2019s a good idea to have these documents ready and available throughout your journey.Entry requirements vary from country to country. It\u2019s very important that you research the exact requirements specific to you before you travel, as certain countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, and possibly bank statements. Your passport must also be valid for the full duration of your stay, with some countries requiring at least 6 months validity. However, all requirements will differ and are subject to your specific circumstances, such as duration of stay, purpose of travel, and the regulations that the country has set.We recommend sourcing information about entry requirements from the country\u2019s official websites.Connecting FlightsConnecting flights refer to you taking multiple flights in order to reach your destination. This results in having a longer journey time, however, it\u2019s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not. This is why more and more travellers are travelling light by shipping their luggage ahead.Many low-cost airlines don't offer connecting flights. This means it's your responsibility to manage your onward connections, and collect your baggage after each flight.If you\u2019re unsure, we recommend that you contact your airline directly.\u26d4 Avoid Airline Baggage Fees \u26a0\ufe0fShip your luggage with My Baggage and avoid large airline baggage fees.TrustpilotAdding additional baggage to your flight or incurring excess baggage fees at the airport can considerably increase the overall cost of travel.Thankfully, My Baggage offers a convenient and cost-effective luggage shipping service that allows you to ship a massive 30KG/66lbs per suitcase at fantastic low rates.

Aspire and its Travel Suppliers are committed to protecting your personal information. This  Policy (the \"Policy\") explains how personal information you provide to the Site is collected and used by Aspire, as well as offline when communicating with Aspire\u2019s call center operators. You should read this Policy before you submit any personal information to redeem travel rewards. By using the Site for the redemption of travel components, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree with the content of this Policy, you should refrain from using the Site for redemption of travel rewards. This Policy does not cover Credit One Bank, Travel Suppliers, third-party providers, distributors, or suppliers, which may or may not be subject to their own  policies. Credit One Bank\u2019s  Policy is located at https://www.creditonebank.com/content/dam/creditonebank/corporate- transactional/pdf/.pdf Personal Information Collected by Aspire and How it is Used In General. Aspire may collect and store any personal information you enter on the Site or provide to Aspire in some other manner. Personal information is data that identifies you and includes (but is not limited to) your name, business or personal  address, physical address, and/or direct telephone number. You are not obligated to provide us with any personal information, unless or until you choose to purchase a reservation or engage in other transactions on the Site. Aspire strives to limit the type of personal information that Aspire collects to information that helps Aspire accomplish its goal of providing a high level of service for the benefit of existing and prospective customers. Purchases. In order to purchase travel and related services through the Site, you may provide Aspire with certain personal information such as your name, your credit card number and expiration date, your credit card billing address, your telephone number, your  address and the name or names of the person(s) traveling (if not you). Aspire may also ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent traveler numbers. Aspire requires this information so that Aspire can process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep you 14 informed of each transaction's status. If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other than yourself, you will need to make sure that each of these other travelers agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to Aspire. For your convenience, Aspire makes certain information about your reservation available to you or other persons authorized by you to receive such information. For example, if you forget your flight number, you or another person authorized by you may retrieve that information from Aspire after providing information sufficient to confirm your identity or that such other person is authorized by you to receive that information. TSA Secure Flight. Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program, most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable) at the time of booking. Aspire will not disclose this information to any third parties other than the applicable airline(s). If you are making a reservation for travellers other than yourself, you should make sure each traveller agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to Aspire for this purpose. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. Information Collected Automatically. When you visit the Site to redeem travel components, Aspire automatically logs generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the internet. This information may consist of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by the user while on the Site. An IP address is a number that allows computers attached to the internet, such as Aspire\u2019s web servers, to know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the website the user wishes to view. Aspire collects this information because it helps analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the Site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the Site, how long visitors to the Site are staying, and how often they are visiting. It also helps Aspire diagnose problems with servers and lets Aspire better administer its systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his/her point of connectivity. Aspire also uses session data to help prevent fraud and/or unauthorized use of the Site. Use of s. s are pieces of information, usually a small text file, that a site transfers to your computer's hard drive and resides there for record keeping purposes. s can make the Site more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. s are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses, or harvest your personal information. The use of s is an industry standard and very common on the internet. s allow Aspire to serve you better and more efficiently by retrieving information previously entered by the user, such as  addresses and zip codes, thereby personalizing your experience at the Site. s in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. The blocking of website s may disable certain features on the Site and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain services available on the Site. Please note that it is possible to block  activity from certain websites while permitting s from sites you trust. Disclosure of Personal Information When you reserve or purchase travel services through the Site for a travel component, Aspire provides to the airline, hotel, car-rental agency, travel agency, or other involved third-party provider, distributor, or supplier only that portion of your personal information needed for the 15 successful fulfillment of your travel arrangement(s). Aspire books most of the travel services through the Global Distribution System (\u201cGDS\u201d), and in doing so must provide certain personal information to them (as Aspire would with any other GDS Aspire now uses or may use in the future). Aspire uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of Aspire customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Site. Aspire may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. Aspire may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their websites. Aspire may also share your personal information with other companies or individuals in the following instances: \u2022 In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, Aspire reserves the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available . \u2022 When Aspire believes it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of the travel provider, our customers, or others; and in connection with our  and  and other agreements. \u2022 In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. International Transfers of Personal Information This Site is operated in the United States and, depending on your country of residence, the submission of personal information to the Site for travel reward redemption may involve some transfer of personal information to the United States. You should be aware that  laws in the United States may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence. Aspire has taken steps to ensure that appropriate levels of protection necessary to maintain the security and quality of your personal information are in place and that any transferred data is processed only in accordance with this Policy.

We may, if we deem it appropriate, refuse carriage to you in the event that we have informed you in writing before your reservation that we shall no longer provide carriage to you on our flights, with effect from the time of our written notification. This may happen if you have contravened the rules of conduct set forth in Articles 7 and 11 on a previous flight and your carriage has consequently become unacceptable. In addition, we may also refuse carriage to you in the event that LUFTHANSA 6/17 7.1.1. this measure is necessary for reasons of safety and security or public order, or to prevent any violation of applicable laws or statutory requirements of any state to or from which a flight arrives, departs or flies over; or 7.1.2. your carriage may adversely affect the safety and security, the health or wellbeing of other passengers to a significant degree; or 7.1.3. your conduct, your condition or frame of mind or physical state, for example, including the effects of alcohol or drug use, are such that you are a danger to yourself, to other passengers or to members of the crew; or 7.1.4. you have behaved on a previous flight in such a manner as to significantly violate our rules of conduct and we have reason to believe that this behaviour could be repeated; or 7.1.5. you have refused to undergo a security check; or 7.1.6. you have not paid the applicable end price; or 7.1.7. you do not possess the travel documents necessary for entry at the point of destination, or you refuse to show them to the crew despite being requested to do so; or 7.1.8. you present a ticket that you have obtained or received illegally, or in violation of the Miles & More  and  of participation, or that has been reported as lost or stolen, or is a forgery, or if you cannot prove your identity as that of the passenger named on the ticket; or 7.1.9. you do not comply with our security regulations; or 7.1.10. you disregard the smoking ban in place in all of our aircraft, while boarding and on board, and you ignore the ban on the use of electronic devices on board.

The carriage of unaccompanied children between the ages of 5 and 12 must be registered beforehand by telephone via the Lufthansa Service Centre and is subject to the fee published in each case and the provisions published in this regard. 7.2.2. Children can also travel in their own child seat secured to a seat; for this, you must book an additional seat for small children under the age of 2. You must secure the child seat throughout the entire flight with the seatbelt available on the seat. The child seat must be suitable for use on board an aircraft. When this is not the case, we are entitled to refuse carriage of the child seat in the cabin. We accept no liability for the consequences resulting from a badly secured child seat, for its improper functioning, or due to failure to comply with instructions. Article 8: Baggage LUFTHANSA 7/17 Free baggage and excess baggage 8.1. The free baggage limits are based on the valid fares published at the time the flight is booked.

We are not liable for any items if these are included in your checked baggage contrary to the provisions of this section. Right to refuse carriage of baggage 8.4. 8.4.1. We can refuse to carry baggage if it does not comply with the  outlined in paragraph 8.3. 8.4.2. We may refuse to carry as baggage any item that we deem unsuitable for carriage because of its size, shape, weight, content, character, or for safety reasons, or because it may negatively affect the well-being of other passengers. Information about items unsuitable for carriage is available upon request. 8.4.3. We may refuse to accept baggage for carriage when it is not properly and suitably packed in suitcases or other similar containers to ensure secure and safe transport when subjected to the customary care during handling. Search of passengers and baggage 8.5. For reasons of safety and security, we may require you to permit a search or screening of your person and your baggage, as well as an X-ray of your baggage.

Checked baggage 8.6. 8.6.1. After delivery of the checked baggage we will take it into our custody and will issue a baggage receipt and a baggage tag for the identification of the baggage. 8.6.2. Checked baggage must have your name or other personal identification affixed to it. 8.6.3. Checked baggage will be transported in the same aircraft in which you are carried, unless this is not possible for safety reasons. If your checked baggage is transported on a subsequent flight, we will deliver it to you at the place you are staying, unless your presence is required for customs inspection. Article 14 (Liability for damage) remains unaffected. Carry-on baggage 8.7. 8.7.1. We shall specify the number, maximum weight and maximum dimensions for carry-on baggage. Carry-on baggage must, in all cases, fit either under the seat in front of you or in the baggage compartments. If your carry-on baggage does not comply with these  or does not meet safety and security requirements, it must be transported as checked baggage. LUFTHANSA 9/17 8.7.2. Items that are not suitable for transport in the cargo hold, such as, for example, fragile musical instruments, and which do not meet the requirements in paragraph 8.7.1. above, will only be accepted for transport in the cabin if you have given us prior notice and we have accepted the item for carriage. We may levy a surcharge for this additional service. Return of checked baggage 8.8. 8.8.1. You are required to collect your baggage as soon as it is made available to you at your final destination or stopover airport. 8.8.2. We only deliver the checked baggage to the holder of the baggage receipt. 8.8.3. If a person claiming checked baggage is unable to produce the baggage receipt or identify the baggage by means of the baggage (identification) tag, we will deliver the baggage to this person only on the condition that their right to collect it has been established to our satisfaction. Carriage of animals 8.9. 8.9.1. The carriage of pets requires our consent and is conditional upon the animals having valid health and vaccination certificates, entry permits and other entry or transit documents required by the respective countries and, in the event that they are not recognised accompanying dogs and assistance dogs, they must be transported properly in shipment cages or approved transport containers. We reserve the right to determine the manner of carriage and to limit the number of animals which may be carried on a flight. Animals travelling in the cabin (including their transport container, when appropriate) must fit in the footwell of your seat and be suitably secured throughout their entire stay on board. Please note the information on our website regarding the carriage of animals as additional carry- on baggage in the cabin: https://www.lufthansa.com/de/en/animals-as-additional-carry-on- baggage. The weight of the animals, their shipment cages and food is not included in the passenger\u2019s free baggage allowance. Excess baggage charges must be paid for carriage. 8.9.2. A recognised guide dog that is necessary for the passenger will be carried free of charge, and if possible, in the cabin; please note the requirements which can be downloaded from https://www.lufthansa.com/de/en/service-dogs for flights outside of the United States of America. 8.9.3. On flights to and from the United States of America, Lufthansa guarantees, within the scope specified by 14 CFR, Part 382 and other legal specifications, the free-of-charge carriage of an assistance dog by a person with a disability (as respectively defined in 14 CFR, Section 382.3) if the accompaniment by an assistance animal is necessary in order to support the passenger when carrying out work or tasks in his/her favour. For the carriage, the prerequisites which can be viewed at https://www.lufthansa.com/de/en/service-dogs apply to flights to/from the United States of America. LUFTHANSA 10/17 Lufthansa only accepts dogs as assistance animals. A passenger with a disability who is travelling with an assistance animal is fully responsible for the safety, health, well-being and behaviour of the assistance animal. This also applies to the interaction of the assistance animal with other passengers and crew members while it is on board the aircraft or in an area of the airport controlled by Lufthansa. 8.9.4. You are solely responsible for the safety, health and behaviour of your pet and are liable for compliance with all entry, departure, health and other regulations and laws, as well as requirements that apply in the country, state or territory from which or into which the animal is carried and/or in which an interim destination is located. This applies in particular to any required health certificates, permits and vaccinations. In particular, Lufthansa is not liable for costs in connection with the housing of the pet in quarantine and for fines and costs in connection with the repatriation of the animal to its place of origin. You are liable for all costs resulting from non-compliance with these responsibilities and from laws, regulations and requirements, as well as for any damage caused by the animals accompanying you, and release us from any liability in this regard, except where we have caused the damage wilfully or by gross negligence. Article 9: Timetables, delays and cancellation of flights deleted Article 10: Refunds General 10.1. 10.1.1. In the event of a cancellation, rebooking or delay, a reimbursement of the fare may be possible under certain , in addition to other claims. 10.1.2. Refunds can also be made in accordance with fare . Some fares include restrictions with regard to refunds. 10.1.3. The refund value of the fare, taxes and fees will be calculated according to the fare  and any segments of the ticket used. Payment fees that are incurred when a certain method of payment is used will not be reimbursed by us. Refund recipient 10.2. As a general rule, the reimbursement is made to the payment method used for booking. The payment is deemed to be a reimbursement to the party entitled to the reimbursement. Currency 10.3. The reimbursement will be made in the same currency in which the ticket was paid. The reimbursement amount may deviate from the amount originally paid for the reimbursed ticket due to conversions and fees of your payment service provider. LUFTHANSA 11/17 Reimbursement in the travel agency 10.4. In the case of tickets booked via a travel agency, the reimbursement amount may deviate from the amount paid by you to the travel agency due to fees that the travel agency has charged. We therefore recommend that you contact the travel agency and have the reimbursement made there. Article 11: Behaviour on board General 11.1. The crew\u2019s instructions are to be followed. If you conduct yourself aboard the aircraft in a manner that endangers the aircraft or any person or property on board, or obstruct the crew in the performance of their duties, or fail to comply with any instructions of the crew, including but not limited to those with respect to smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, or behave in a manner which causes discomfort, inconvenience, damage or injury to other passengers or the crew, we may take such measures as we deem reasonably necessary to prevent continuation of such conduct, including restraint. You may be refused onward carriage by us and may be prosecuted for your conduct on board the aircraft. Electronic devices 11.2. The use of mobile phones, radios and remote-control toys is not permitted on board. Mobile phones, however, may be used on flights that are equipped with functional mobile phone technology. On these aircrafts, the use of mobile phones is allowed in accordance with the crew\u2019s instructions. Speech telephony is prohibited in all cases. Non-smoking flights 11.3. All Lufthansa flights are non-smoking flights. Smoking is prohibited in all areas of the aircraft. This also applies to e-cigarettes. Alcoholic beverages 11.4.

Taking photographs and filming on board may be prohibited by the crew at any time. (11.7. has been deleted.) Article 12: Additional services LUFTHANSA 12/17 12.1. If we make arrangements for you with any third party to provide services other than flight- related services, or to issue carriage documents for carriage services not relating to flights, in doing so we are acting only as your agent. In these cases, the  and  of the third- party service provider will apply. 12.2. For shuttle services that we provide for our passengers ourselves, and which do not include flight services, separate  to those mentioned above may apply. They can be sent to you upon request. Article 13: Administrative formalities General 13.1. 13.1.1. You are obligated and solely responsible for obtaining all required travel documents and visas and for complying with all laws and regulations of countries that you will fly from or into or through which you will transit; the same applies to our regulations and instructions in this regard. Your travel documents and visas must be valid for the entire duration of your journey, including any breaks in travel. We do not accept any responsibility in this regard; in particular, we are not obliged to check the validity of documents. 13.1.2. We shall not be liable for the consequences that result from your failure to carry such documents or visas with you, or your failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or instructions. Travel documents 13.2. Prior to travel and at our request, you must present all entry and exit documents, as well as health and other certificates required by the destination or transit countries and, if necessary, permit us to take and retain copies thereof. We reserve the right to refuse carriage if you have not complied with these requirements, or if your travel documents are incomplete, and we are not liable for any loss suffered or expenses incurred by you as a result of your failure to comply with these provisions. Denial of entry 13.3. If, for any reason, you are denied entry into a country, you are obligated to pay the applicable airfare in the event that we must return you to your place of departure or another destination because you are not allowed to enter the respective country (a transit or destination country). We may apply to the payment of such an airfare any funds paid to us by you for unused carriage. We will not refund the fare paid for carriage to the point of refusal of entry or deportation. Liability of passengers for fines, etc. 13.4. If we are required to pay or deposit any fines or penalties or to incur any other expenditures by reason of your failure to comply with the laws or regulations on entry to or travel through the country concerned, or to produce the required documents in the proper form, you shall be obligated to reimburse us on demand any amounts so paid or deposited. LUFTHANSA 13/17 Customs inspection 13.5. If required, you shall submit to an inspection of both your checked and carry-on baggage by customs or other government officials. We are not liable for any damage suffered by the passenger in the course of such an inspection or through your failure to comply with this requirement. Security inspection 13.6. You are obligated to submit to, and have your baggage submitted to, any security checks carried out by government authorities, airport officials or by us. Transmission of data 13.7. We are entitled to transmit your passport data and all of your personal data processed and used by us in connection with your flight to domestic and foreign authorities (including US and Canadian authorities) if these authorities request us to do so due to compelling statutory requirements and in order to fulfil the contract of carriage. Article 14: Liability for damage General 14.1. 14.1.1. Transport is subject to the liability order of the Agreement of Montreal of 28 March 1999 (\u201cMontreal Convention\u201d), which was implemented in the European Community by Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 in the version amended by Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002 and the national legislation of the member states. 14.1.2. If the injured party has contributed to causing the damage which has arisen, the norms of the applicable national law in  of the exclusion or the reduction of the liability to pay damages with contributive fault of the injured party apply. 14.1.3. Law action in court for compensation pursuant to the Montreal Convention must be filed within two years, starting with the date of arrival of the aircraft, or the day on which the aircraft should have arrived, or on which the carriage was interrupted. 14.1.4. We are not liable for damages that arise from our fulfilment of state regulations or that arise due to your failure to fulfil your obligations. 14.1.5. Under no circumstances will our liability exceed the amount of the damage documented. We are only liable for indirect or consequential damage if we or our personnel have caused it in a grossly negligent or wilful manner. This does not apply to personal injury. 14.1.6. The exclusions from liability and the liability restrictions of the Montreal Convention and of the respectively applicable national law shall apply, unless otherwise explicitly stipulated by these  of Carriage. Compensation in the event of death or injury 14.2. 14.2.1. There are no maximum compensation amounts for liability in the event of the death or LUFTHANSA 14/17 injury of passengers. For damage of up to SDR 128,821 (approx. EUR 150,000), the carrier shall not be able to contest claims for damages with reference to fault. Receivables that exceed this amount can only be averted by the carrier by the latter proving that both it itself and its people did not act in a negligent or otherwise culpable manner, and that no negligent or otherwise culpable omission is the cause. Advance payments 14.2.2. If a passenger is killed or injured, the carrier must make an advance payment within 15 days of the identification of the person entitled to damage, in order to cover their immediate economic needs. In the event of death, the advance payment is no less than SDR 16,000 (approx. EUR 19,000). Damage to or loss or destruction of baggage 14.3. 14.3.1. In the case of checked baggage pursuant to Art. 8.6 of these  of Carriage, a culpability-independent liability exists unless the baggage was already damaged beforehand. With non-checked baggage, we are only liable for our culpable behaviour and that of our personnel. Liability limits for baggage 14.3.2. We are liable for damage to or loss or destruction of baggage up to SDR 1,288 (approx. EUR 1,500). A higher liability limit applies if the passenger submits a special declaration regarding the amount-based interest in the delivery of the checked baggage at the destination at the latest upon check-in and pays the requested surcharge. In this case, the agreed amount is deemed to be the liability limit if the carrier cannot prove that the agreed amount is higher than the actual interest of the passenger in the delivery of the checked baggage at the destination. Complaints with regard to baggage 14.3.3. If you accept the baggage delivered to you unconditionally, we take for granted, as long as the opposite is not proven, that it was delivered to you in good condition and according to the contract of carriage. In the event of damage to or loss or destruction of baggage, the passenger must request compensation from the airline as soon as possible in writing or in text format. In the event of damage to baggage, all legal action is excluded if the entitled party does not notify the carrier immediately after the damage is discovered, but in the case of checked baggage, no later than seven days after the acceptance of the baggage. This does not apply if the carrier has acted in a fraudulent manner. 14.3.4. We are not liable for damages caused by items in your baggage, unless it is due to gross negligence or an intentional act on our part. If these items cause damage to the baggage of other passengers or to our property, you are obliged to compensate us for all damages and expenses resulting therefrom. Delays in the carriage of passengers and baggage 14.4. 14.4.1. We are liable for damages due to delays during the carriage of passengers and in the carriage of checked baggage, unless we and our personnel took all reasonable measures to prevent the damages, or if taking these measures was not possible for us or our personnel. LUFTHANSA 15/17 Liability limits for damages arising from delays 14.4.2. Liability for damages arising from delays in the carriage of passengers is limited to SDR 5,346 (approx. EUR 6,000). 14.4.3. Liability for damages arising from delays in the carriage of travel baggage is limited to SDR 1,288 (approx. EUR 1,500). A higher liability limit applies if the passenger submits a special declaration regarding the amount-based interest in the delivery of the checked baggage at the place of destination and pays the required surcharge at the latest upon check-in. In this case, the agreed amount is deemed to be the liability limit if the carrier cannot prove that the agreed amount is higher than the actual interest of the passenger in the delivery of the checked baggage at the place of destination. Complaints with regard to baggage 14.4.4. In the case of damage that has been caused by the delayed delivery of baggage, the passenger must notify the carrier as quickly as possible in writing or in text form. In the event of damage due to delays, all legal action is excluded if the entitled party does not give notification of the damage within 21 days after the delivery of the baggage. This does not apply if the carrier has acted in a fraudulent manner. Co-culpability of the passenger 14.4.5. If the injured party has contributed to causing the damage which has arisen, the amount of the compensation claim is to be reduced in proportion to the contributory negligence of said party. In particular, the injured party is obliged not to increase the compensation amount caused by the loss or delayed carriage of his/her baggage through unreasonable replacement purchases. Article 15: Headings The headings in these  of Carriage are only for transparency and are not relevant for interpretation or for making claims for damages. Article 16: Other  Carriage is subject to certain additional regulations and  that apply to our circumstances, or are published by us. These regulations and  may vary from time to time.

While we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of this Internet version of the final rule, it is not the official version.

Once the official version of this final rule is published in the Federal Register, this version will be removed from the Internet and replaced with a link to the official version. Billing Code 4910-9X DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of the Secretary 14 CFR Parts 259 and 399 [Docket No. DOT-OST-2022-0109] RIN No. 2105-AF10 Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees AGENCY: Office of the Secretary (OST), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Transportation (Department or DOT) is issuing a final rule to strengthen protections for consumers by ensuring that they have access to fee information for transporting baggage and changing or canceling a flight before ticket purchase. Under the final rule, U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents must clearly disclose passenger- specific or itinerary-specific fees for these services to consumers whenever fare and schedule information is provided for flights to, within, and from the United States. The Department is further requiring that carriers provide useable, current, and accurate information regarding fees for these critical ancillary services to any entity that is required to disclose critical ancillary service fee information to consumers. This final rule is in response to the Executive order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which directs the Department to take various actions to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers. The rule will ensure that consumers have the information they need to understand the true costs of air transportation that apply to them, which will create a more competitive market with better outcomes for consumers. DATES: This rule becomes effective on [INSERT DATE 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Heather Filemyr, Ryan Patanaphan, or Blane A. Workie, Office of Aviation Consumer Protection, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Ave., SE, Washington, DC, 20590, 202-366-9342, 202-366-7152 (fax), heather.filemyr@dot.gov, ryan.patanaphan@dot.gov, or blane.workie@dot.gov (e-mail). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Executive Summary (1) Purpose of the Regulatory Action The purpose of this final rule is to ensure that consumers know upfront the fees carriers charge for transporting a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag and for canceling or changing a reservation to avoid surprise fees that can add up quickly and add significant cost to what may, at first, look like a cheap ticket. Airlines1 have imposed separate fees for ancillary services related to air travel beyond passenger air transportation as part of their business model for many years.2 Ancillary service fees are not subject to the 7.5% airline ticket tax that is used to support the Aviation Trust Fund. These ancillary fees have become more complex over time and continue to confuse consumers, as explained in section B (2). Which airlines impose such fees, what services require payment of a fee, the amount of the fee, and whether the same fees apply to all passengers are in a continuous state of change. For example, during the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) public health emergency, several airlines advertised the elimination of ticket change fees, but despite these general announcements, airlines continued to 1 The preamble in this final rule uses the term \u201cairlines\u201d to refer to \u201cair carriers\u201d and \u201cforeign air carriers\u201d as those  are used in the Department\u2019s regulations. The two  are defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(2) and (a)(21). 2 See, e.g., Comment from the International Air Transport Association, p.4 (\u201cAirlines have been separating baggage fees from the core transportation service for more than 14 years . . . .\u201d), available at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0085. impose, or later reimposed, change fees for certain fare types such as \u201cbasic economy.\u201d3 In this context, consumer organizations have long advocated for more upfront disclosure of ancillary fees.4 On July 9, 2021, the President issued E.O. 14036, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d5 which launched a whole-of-government approach to strengthen competition across many sectors, including commercial aviation. Section 5, paragraph (m)(i)(F) of E.O. 14036 directed the Department to \u201cconsider initiating a rulemaking to ensure that consumers have ancillary fee information, including \u2018baggage fees,\u2019 \u2018change fees,\u2019 and \u2018cancellation fees,\u2019 at the time of ticket purchase.\u201d This rulemaking responds to the direction in E.O. 14036 to provide improved ancillary fee disclosures to consumers purchasing air transportation.6 (2) Overview of Existing Requirements In 2011, the Department issued a final rule titled, \u201cEnhancing Airline Passenger Protections,\u201d7 that sought to address consumer concerns regarding the proliferation of ancillary fees. In the rule, the Department added several disclosure requirements for airlines: (1) a disclosure on the homepage for at least three months of any increase in the fee for passenger baggage or any change in the free baggage allowance for checked or carry-on baggage; (2) a 3 See, e.g., Delta Air Lines, Delta Eliminates Change Fees, Building On Commitment to Flexibility for Consumers, Aug. 31, 2020, Alaska Airlines, Fly with Peace of Mind: Alaska Airlines Eliminates Change Fees Permanently, Sept. 1, 2020, American Airlines, Wave Goodbye to Change Fees, Spirit Airlines, How Can I Change or Cancel My Reservation?

See also Final Rule, Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, 76 FR 23110, 23142 (Apr. 25, 2011). 5 86 FR 36987 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/14/2021-15069/promoting-competition-in-the- american-economy). 6 This rulemaking also addresses section 5, paragraph (m)(i)(B) of E.O.14036. That section directed the Department to promote enhanced transparency and consumer safeguards, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including through potential rulemaking, enforcement actions, or guidance documents, with the aims of enhancing consumer access to airline flight information so that consumers can more easily find a broader set of available flights, including by new or lesser known airlines; and ensuring that consumers are not exposed or subject to advertising, marketing, pricing, and charging of ancillary fees that may constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition. 7 76 FR 23110, supra. notice on the first screen with a fare disclosure that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and where consumers can go to access these baggage fees; (3) a notice on e-ticket confirmations regarding the free baggage allowance for that flight and any applicable fee for the first and second checked bag and carry-on bag; and (4) a disclosure of all fees for optional services in one central place on the seller\u2019s website, with non-baggage fees permitted to be expressed as ranges. Under the 2011 rule, the Department determined that checked and carry-on baggage were \u201cfundamental\u201d to air travel, and the Department required that fees for such services be expressed as specific charges on a central place on the airline\u2019s website (alongside other ancillary fees), with information about any differing prices and allowances based on the passenger\u2019s status. Based on ticket agent concerns that the rule would be costly to ticket agents as airlines are \u201cupdating and changing fees constantly,\u201d8 the Department applied fewer or modified disclosure requirements to ticket agents. Based on continued feedback by various stakeholders and advisory committees (further discussed below), the Department explored further changes to ancillary fee disclosure requirements in a 2014 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)9 and a 2017 supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM)10. These efforts are further described in section B below, though neither resulted in changes to the regulation. (3) Summary of Major Provisions This final rule increases the protections provided to consumers as set forth in the summary table below. Subject Requirement Covered Entities The final rule applies to U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents (excluding corporate travel agents) that advertise or sell air transportation directly to consumers. 8 Id. at 23145. 9 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014). 10 82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017). The Department defers for a later rulemaking the determination of whether metasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents that must disclose ancillary fee information required by this rule. Critical Ancillary The rule defines critical ancillary services as any ancillary service critical to Services consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The ancillary services that this final rule identifies as critical to consumers are as follows: (1) transporting a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag; and (2) changing or canceling a reservation. Any other service may also be determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary. Disclosure of Fees and The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose fees for critical Policies for Critical ancillary services during the itinerary search process at the first point where a Ancillary Services fare and schedule is provided in connection with a specific flight itinerary. The fee disclosure includes noting that a fare category does not allow changing or canceling a reservation or transporting a checked or carry-on bag if that is the case. Policies for critical ancillary services must be disclosed before ticket purchase when a search is conducted online but are not required to be disclosed with the fare and schedule. The information disclosed must be accurate, clear, and conspicuous. Fees cannot be displayed through a hyperlink, but disclosure is permitted using pop-ups, expandable text, or other means. Links to Book a Flight This final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that sell airline tickets to with a Carrier or an disclose critical ancillary service fees on the first page of their online Online Travel Agency platforms to which consumers are directed after searching for flight options (OTA) on another entity\u2019s online platform (a metasearch site) unless the consumer was already provided accurate fee information on the directing entity\u2019s online platform. Passenger-Specific This final rule requires carriers and ticket agents to disclose the fees for and Anonymous critical ancillary services as passenger-specific itinerary information if a Searches consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search. A passenger-specific itinerary search refers to a search that takes into account information specific to the passenger (e.g., the passenger\u2019s status in the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, the passenger\u2019s military status, or the passenger\u2019s status as a holder of a particular credit card) that was affirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the itinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class such as full fare ticket) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied. An anonymous itinerary search refers to a search that does not take into account information specific to the passenger but does take into account information specific to the itinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class such as full fare ticket) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied. Opting Out of The final rule does not permit airlines and ticket agents to omit disclosure of Disclosures first checked, second checked, or carry-on baggage fees with the fare and schedule information on their online platform unless: (1) the airline/ticket agent asks consumers at the beginning of a search if they intend to travel with a carry-on bag or checked bags; and (2) a consumer affirmatively indicates that no one in the booking party intends to travel with carry-on bag or first or second checked bags. The final rule does not permit airlines or ticket agents to enable consumers to opt out of display of change and cancellation fees on the airline\u2019s or ticket agent\u2019s online platform. Disclosures on Online The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees and Platforms policies for critical ancillary services on airlines\u2019 or ticket agents\u2019 online platforms. The final rule defines \u201conline platforms\u201d to be any interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent. Offline (Telephone, The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose to consumers In-person) Disclosures during an in-person or telephone inquiry that critical ancillary fees apply if of Airline Ancillary that is the case and upon request disclose those fees to consumers. Service Fees Sharing of Airline This final rule requires airlines to provide critical ancillary fee information to Ancillary Service Fee any entity that is required to disclose critical ancillary service fee information Information to consumers. Percentage-Off The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that advertise percentage-off Advertisements discounts of a \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare\u201d to apply the percentage-off discount to the full fare (i.e., all mandatory government taxes/fees and carrier-imposed charges/fees). The final rule requires airlines and ticket agents that advertise percentage-off discounts of a \u201cbase fare\u201d to apply the percentage-off discount to the full fare amount excluding all government taxes and charges (i.e., all mandatory carrier-imposed charges/fees). Compliance/ The final rule requires that: (1) airlines must provide required critical Implementation Period ancillary fee data to ticket agents not later than six months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or October 30, 2024; (2) airlines must comply with all other regulatory requirements no later than 12 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or April 30, 2025; (3) ticket agents that do not meet the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of small entity must comply with all regulatory requirements no later than 18 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or October 30, 2025; and (4) ticket agents that that meet the SBA definition of small entity must comply with all regulatory requirements no later than 24 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or April 30, 2026. (4) Costs and Benefits The final rule changes how U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose information about certain ancillary fees for flights. Expected benefits of the rule result from the reduction of excess consumption of air travel, or deadweight loss, which occurs because consumers who are unaware of ancillary service fees behave as if the price for air travel is lower than it is. Annual benefits from reducing deadweight loss are expected to amount to $5.5 million. The other source of benefits estimated by the Department is from the time consumers will save when they search for airfare because they no longer need to interrupt their search to find information on ancillary service fees. Depending on assumptions regarding the number of consumers who consider ancillary fee information when they search for airfare, time savings benefits are expected to range from $365 million to $484 million annually. Expected costs of this rule include costs to consumers due to the time needed to navigate increased amounts of information, which range from $239 million to $331 million annually. The primary estimated costs of the rule to carriers and ticket agents are the costs that they would incur to modify their websites by adjusting their displays of fares, schedules, and fees. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) and direct- channel companies might incur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though the Department acknowledges that these entities are already upgrading systems for market reasons and have been for several years. Quantified costs range from $286 million to $378 million annually. One effect of better information on ancillary fees is that some consumers will pay less for the ancillary services they use when they travel by air. These economic effects are not societal benefits or costs but represent a transfer from airlines to consumers, estimated to be about $543 million annually. This transfer represents $543 million in overpayment in fees for consumers, or from the perspective of airlines, additional revenue from consumers who are surprised by fees and, for example, then need to pay a higher fee at the airport to check a bag. This transfer, as well as the benefits due to any reduction in deadweight loss, accrue to consumers and are expected to occur regardless of any time savings impacts. B. Background (1) Existing Ancillary Fee Disclosure Requirements As noted above, the Department\u2019s existing regulations in 14 CFR 399.85 contain the requirements for ancillary fee disclosures as promulgated in the 2011 final rule. Under 14 CFR 399.85(a), airlines must promptly and prominently disclose any increase in fees for a carry-on or first and second checked bags and any change in bag allowances on the homepages of their websites. Paragraph (b) requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose clearly and prominently on the first screen with a fare quotation for a specific itinerary that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and where consumers can see these fees. Ticket agents may refer consumers to the airline websites for specific baggage fee information or to their own sites if they display airline baggage fees. Paragraph (c) requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose on e-ticket confirmations information regarding passengers\u2019 free baggage allowances and applicable fees for a carry-on bag and a first and second checked bag, expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors that affect those charges such as passenger status. Paragraph (d) requires airlines to disclose the fees for all ancillary services on their websites, accessible through a conspicuous link from the carrier\u2019s homepage. The paragraph notes that such fees may generally be expressed as a range, but baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors that affect those charges. Requirements in other regulations also have an impact on ancillary fees. Under 14 CFR 253.7, airlines may not impose any  restricting refunds of the ticket price, charging monetary penalties on passengers, or raising the ticket price, unless the passenger receives conspicuous written notice of the salient features of those  on or with the ticket. In 14 CFR 399.88, sellers of scheduled air transportation may not increase the price of passenger baggage after the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer. As stated in the NPRM for this rulemaking, while the text of 14 CFR 399.88 references ancillary fees such as seat fees, the Department announced in 2011 that it would enforce the prohibition on post-purchase price increases only for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags.11 (2) Problems with Existing Requirements and Efforts to Improve Disclosures Following the 2011 final rule, described above, the Department issued an NPRM titled \u201cTransparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues\u201d in 2014.12 The 2014 rulemaking contained various proposals to enhance consumer protections, including a proposal to require the disclosure of certain airline ancillary service fees (i.e., first checked bag, second checked bag, one carry-on item, and advance seat selection) to consumers through all sales channels on the first page on which a fare is displayed in response to a specific flight itinerary search request. The proposal to require disclosure of certain ancillary fees was based in part on a recommendation by the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee (FAAC).13 The FAAC\u2019s 2010 report had noted that, despite improvements in the air consumer experience, FAAC members felt that consumers sought greater transparency in the total cost of their tickets and that they should have the ability to choose between carriers that either do not charge for certain services or charge differing fees. The 2014 NPRM also relied on the statements of a successor committee, the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection (ACACP), which in 2012 adopted the FAAC recommendation and added that all participants in the airfare 11 See also Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket (December 28, 2011). The application of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was at issue in a lawsuit filed by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the December 28, 2011, guidance and upheld the Department's rule prohibiting post-purchase price increases as it is currently being applied. Spirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20-21. Petition for Writ of Certiorari denied on April 1, 2013. 12 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014). 13 See Recommendation 11, in FAAC Final Report (2010), available at https://www.transportation.gov/highlights/future-aviation-advisory-committee/faac-final-report. and fee distribution system should be guided by principles of transparency, providing choices and offers that meet consumer needs, and knowing the full price before purchase.14 While the ACACP commended the Department\u2019s regulatory efforts to add transparency, it noted that the aviation industry offered a variety of business models, network choices, and optional services, and that the level of choice was creating complexity for consumers. The ACACP had heard from advocates and ticket agents that consumers expect to know the cost of the entire trip before purchasing a ticket.15 In issuing the 2014 proposal on disclosure of certain airline ancillary service fees, the Department explained that the proposal was necessary because the 2011 rule, while a step in the right direction, did not fully address the problem of lack of transparency of ancillary services and products. The 2014 proposal on disclosure of airline ancillary service fees generated significant comments from consumers, airlines, ticket agents, and other interested parties. During the pendency of the 2014 rulemaking, the ACACP recommended that DOT require that change and cancellation fees be clear and displayed before ticket purchase.16 Consumer advocates had asserted at an ACACP meeting held on June 23, 2015, that such fees had become significant and difficult to ascertain.17 At that time, the ACACP also discussed baggage fees and allowances, with consumer advocates noting that baggage allowance rules were confusing to consumers and that it was difficult for consumers to understand which airline\u2019s rules apply. At the same meeting, a ticket agent representative stated that every baggage fee scheme had \u201cmultiple layers and exceptions\u201d that were not always dynamically available to ticket agents.18 14 Report of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 7\u20138 (Oct. 22, 2012), available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/1st-ACACP-Report-22OCT2012. 15 Id., see, e.g., Transcript - Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection, First Meeting, June 28, 2012, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2012-0087-0095. 16 Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3 (Sept. 1, 2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/9th-meeting-Sept-1/record. 17 See Record of Meeting, Eighth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3\u20135 (June 23, 2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/resources/individuals/aviation- consumer-protection/285976/acacp-record-8th-meeting-23june2015.pdf; see also Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection (Sept. 1, 2015). 18 Id. In 2016, the Department decided not to issue a final rule on the issue of transparency of airline ancillary services given the complexity of the issues and additional considerations identified by comments submitted on the 2014 NPRM. Instead, the Department decided to seek additional information on the disclosure of fees for ancillary services in a supplemental rulemaking.19 In January 2017, the Department issued an SNPRM, which focused solely on the issue of transparency of certain ancillary service fees.20 In the 2017 SNPRM, the Department proposed to require fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag to be disclosed at all points of sale wherever fare and schedule information is provided to consumers. While the SNPRM was pending, in September 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that consumer group representatives stated that it had become \u201cincreasingly difficult for consumers to compare airfare ticket prices, fees, and associated rules, and understand what is included in their purchases.\u201d21 On December 14, 2017, the SNPRM was withdrawn with the Department noting that the withdrawal is consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.22 After the withdrawal, a number of State attorneys general urged the Department to reverse its decision, stating that they \u201cregularly hear reports from consumers in [their] states who are confused and frustrated by these fees, which significantly alter the total cost of travel.\u201d23 E.O. 13771 was later revoked.24 While the disclosure regulations promulgated in 2011 remain in place, consumer advocates continue to express concerns to the Department that there is a market failure in air 19 In 2016, the Department issued a final rule that promulgated regulations related to carrier reporting, disclosure of codeshare operations, and display bias, while separating out the ancillary fee disclosure and ticket agent definition issues into separate rulemaking efforts. 81 FR 76800 (Nov. 3, 2016). The ticket agent rulemaking remains pending. See Fall 2023 Unified Agenda for rulemaking titled \u201cAir Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents\u201d (RIN 2105-AE57) at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57. 20 82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017). 21 GAO 17-756, Commercial Aviation: Information on Airline Fees for Optional Services (September 2017), p. 33 at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-756.pdf. 22 82 FR 58778 (Dec. 14, 2017). 23 Letter from attorneys general from 16 States and the District of Columbia to Secretary Elaine L. Chao (Dec. 20, 2017). 24 On January 20, 2021, the President issued E.O. 13992, \u201cRevocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation,\u201d which revoked E.O. 13771 and certain other Executive orders. transportation pricing because consumers are unable to determine the true cost of air travel prior to ticket purchase. They have also raised concerns that consumers often find the process of determining the baggage fees that apply to them to be a complicated and time-consuming process. Consumer advocates have asserted that a lack of passenger-specific information regarding fees for ancillary services at the time of ticket purchase is causing a market failure by limiting the ability of consumers to understand the true cost of the travel they are looking to purchase and compare pricing between carriers and travel options. Consumer advocates have also noted a significant increase in the number of ancillary service fees imposed by carriers. Certain members of Congress have expressed support for full, more specific, disclosure of ancillary service fees. Members of Congress have also sponsored legislation on this topic.25 Further, the Joint Explanatory Statement of the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act requested that the Department work in collaboration with industry, consumers, and other stakeholders to establish guidelines on transparency of airline ancillary fees.26 Subsequently, the Department tasked the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) with examining this issue again.27 In 2019, during a meeting of the ACPAC, two consumer organizations underscored the difficulties faced by consumers in determining the total cost of air travel.28 Consumer advocates maintained that consumers were confused by the complex charts that carriers and ticket agents provide to consumers to determine their baggage fees. The ACPAC heard from several consumer 25 See, e.g., Letter from Representative Nita M. Lowey to Secretary Elaine Chao (Dec. 8, 2017). See also section 203 of S. 3222, Airline Passengers\u2019 Bill of Rights (introduced by Senators Blumenthal, Markey, Whitehouse, Wyden, and Casey on November 17, 2021) at https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3222/text?r=7&s=1, proposing to mandate that DOT require airlines, online travel agencies (OTAs), metasearch engines and other ticket agents that provide flight search tools disclose all applicable taxes and ancillary fees at any point in which the fare is shown and in telephone communication with a prospective consumer in the U.S. at any point in which the cost of the air transportation is disclosed.

Consumer organizations that presented to the ACPAC stressed the importance of ensuring consumers can accurately and easily compare travel costs, inclusive of ancillary fees, and they recommended that ancillary fee information should be clearly displayed early in consumer purchase decisions.29 In December 2020, the ACPAC submitted a report to the Department recommending that the Department remain vigilant to ensure compliance with the existing transparency requirements. The ACPAC was silent on whether the Department should issue a new rulemaking on transparency of airline ancillary fees.30 In July 2021, E.O. 14036 directed the Department to consider initiating a rulemaking to ensure consumers have ancillary fee information at the time of ticket purchase. Based on E.O. 14036 and the above-described history of concerns raised by consumer organizations and individual consumers, including the individual complaints the Department has received reflecting the confusion consumers experience regarding ancillary fees,31 the Department determined that this rulemaking is necessary to address ongoing inadequacies in existing ancillary fee disclosure requirements. It appears that consumers are generally unaware of the amount of the ancillary fees that apply to them when they book tickets. Consumer advocates contend that the ancillary services and fees that airlines currently post on their websites are not sufficiently useful to consumers to determine the cost of travel because airlines generally provide a range of fees for ancillary services aside from baggage. Airlines acknowledge that the fees for ancillary services often vary based on various factors such as the 29 See Summary of April 4, 2019 ACPAC Meeting 10\u201316, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0019; see also Summary of September 24, 2020 ACPAC Meeting 19\u201320, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0025. 30 Report of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee 5 (Dec. 31, 2020), available at https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/acpac-report-secretary-transportation- december-31-2020. 31 See, e.g., https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0021, https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0022, and https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0023. type of aircraft used, the flight on which a passenger is booked, or the time at which a passenger pays for the service or product. Regarding baggage fees, consumer advocacy organizations have reported to the Department that consumers often find the process of determining the baggage fees that apply to them to be a complicated and time-consuming process. Consumer advocates also expressed the view that because most passengers travel once per year or less, they may not be aware of certain ancillary service fees.32 Advocates further argued that the practice of drip pricing, a pricing technique in which firms advertise only part of the price and reveal other charges later as the customer goes through the buying process, tends to lock consumers into engaging with a given seller, and reduces competition, because the customer has invested time and energy into the purchasing process and thus is less likely to abandon the purchase entirely and re-institute a fuller search for options.33 Following the issuance of E.O. 14036, the ACPAC met again in June 2022 to address the issue of transparency of airline ancillary service fees.34 During the meeting, DOT solicited comment on topics being considered for the NPRM on ancillary fee transparency. These topics included identifying ancillary service fees critical to consumers, the sharing of airline data regarding critical ancillary service fees with ticket agents, and how to best display this information to consumers. DOT also solicited comment on whether fees for certain ancillary services should be disclosed at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed. At the meeting, a consumer advocate stated that consumers still do not know the specific amounts of baggage and change and cancellation fees that apply during the ticket purchase process.35 32 Presentation of FlyersRights.org (FlyersRights), available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST- 2018-0190-0046. 33 Id.; see also Presentation of American Antitrust Institute, available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 morning session), and Federal Trade Commission, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HOTEL RESORT FEES, (Jan. 2017), available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/economic-analysis-hotel-resort- fees/p115503_hotel_resort_fees_economic_issues_paper.pdf. 34 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting. A webcast of the meeting is available to view on the ACPAC website. Speakers\u2019 materials have been posted to the ACPAC docket at https://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2018-0190. On the second day of the meeting, the ACPAC addressed the separate but related issue of availability of airline flight information. 35 Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) June 28 and 29, 2022 Meeting Minutes 8, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0073. Another consumer advocate expressed concerns with drip pricing.36 The advocate also stated that baggage fees vary by airline and can depend on the flight, the time, and the day. A representative of the American Antitrust Institute stated that cancellation fees were discontinued at the beginning of the pandemic and then returned, and that drip pricing practices lock consumers into higher costs and suppresses competition. The representative also urged the Department to set policies to provide full fee information up front so consumers can make informed purchasing decisions based on the total cost of their itineraries.37 The Department continues to receive hundreds of consumer complaints each year regarding ancillary fees.38 Based on past experience, the Department understands that the number of consumer complaints it receives directly from consumers is a small fraction of the total complaints received each year by airlines and ticket agents.39 The requirements to provide specific baggage fee information and a range of fees for other ancillary services have not been as helpful to consumers in determining the true cost of travel as the Department had anticipated when issuing its final rule in 2011. C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The Department published its NPRM on Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees on October 20, 2022.40 The NPRM was initially open to public comment for a period of 60 days (until December 19, 2022). During this time, the ACPAC was informed about the NPRM\u2019s principal provisions and heard from stakeholders at its meeting on December 8, 2022. Following several commenters\u2019 request for an extension due to the complexity of the 36 Id. at 9. 37 Id. at 10. 38 As noted in the NPRM of the present rulemaking, the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) received over 550 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees and over 140 complaints regarding seat fees in 2021. In 2022, OACP received over 750 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees. During the first 5 months of 2023, OACP received over 300 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees. 39 Compare, e.g., the 2,095 disability complaints filed with the Department in 2022 (available on page 66 of Air Travel Consumer Report issued February 2023, https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023- 04/February%202023%20ATCR_Revised.pdf), and the 42,306 disability complaints received by airlines in 2022 (available at https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/2022-disability- related-complaints-received-all). 40 87 FR 63718 (Oct. 20, 2022). rulemaking, the comment period was extended for 35 days until January 23, 2023.41 On January 12, 2023, the ACPAC met again to deliberate and make recommendations related to the NPRM. Then, on January 18, 2023, the Department received a request to further extend the comment period on the basis that the requestor was not able to view the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, and that at the time the request for extension was submitted, the meeting materials had not been posted to the docket. On January 20, 2023, the Department declined to extend the comment period based on that request noting that a video recording of the full meeting was posted publicly.42 The Department received another request for additional time to provide comments on the NPRM, based primarily on technological and interface issues identified by the petitioner. In response, the Department posted a notice to its website stating that it was considering whether to grant that request and provided a preliminary list of recommendations made by the ACPAC at its January 12 meeting.43 On January 23, 2023, three commenters petitioned the Department for a public hearing on the NPRM pursuant to the Department\u2019s regulation on rulemakings relating to unfair and deceptive practices, 14 CFR 399.75. By a notice on March 14, 2023, the Department scheduled the hearing for March 30, 2023, and reopened the rulemaking to public comment from March 14 through April 6, 2023 (seven days following the hearing).44 (1) Overview of Proposals In the NPRM, the Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents to disclose on the first page displayed following an itinerary search the fees for a first and second checked bag, a carry-on bag, ticket change and cancellation, and seat assignments that would enable a child 13 or under to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult (\u201cfamily seating\u201d). The fees would need to be disclosed on the first page displayed following an itinerary search in which fare 41 87 FR 77765 (Dec. 20, 2022). 42 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Denial-Extension-Comment-Period. See also 88 FR 4923 (Jan. 26, 2023). 43 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Procedural-Information-January23-2023. 44 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023). and itinerary information is shown, and they would need to be adjusted based on passenger- specific information provided by the consumer. The NPRM also proposed that the disclosures be displayed on the screen without the use of links or pop-ups, and that the same disclosures also be made during in-person or phone transactions. To enable ticket agents to provide the disclosures, the NPRM proposed that airlines provide fee rule information to ticket agents that sell or display air transportation. The Department did not propose to require that airlines provide the information to GDSs, which facilitate the purchase of tickets between airlines and consumers, but do not display or sell airline tickets to consumers. The NPRM proposed that these data sharing and disclosure requirements would become effective within six months of the issuance of a final rule. Specific provisions of the NPRM are discussed in more detail in section E of this document. (2) ACPAC Meetings on the Proposals As noted above, after the NPRM was published, the ACPAC held two meetings to deliberate on the NPRM\u2019s provisions and to make recommendations. At its December 8, 2022, meeting, the ACPAC heard from Department staff regarding the proposed rule\u2019s provisions and from members of the public regarding their views.45 The ACPAC\u2019s airline representative raised questions about the need for a rulemaking and asked about the Department\u2019s application of the unfair and deceptive practices standard. He questioned the Department\u2019s analysis of whether consumers were substantially injured. A member of the public representing the International Air Transport Association (IATA) also questioned whether consumers were unaware of the price imposed for baggage or seating before purchasing a ticket, and he indicated that it would be costly and time-consuming for systems to conduct complex calculations on a passenger- or itinerary-specific basis to produce the proposed fee disclosures. He expressed his view that the rule should make fee information clear to consumers before purchase rather than during the itinerary search stage. The ACPAC\u2019s consumer representative raised questions about the impact 45 Meeting minutes are available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0110. the proposed disclosures would have on the amount of information being presented to consumers on screen. A member of the public representing Travelers United expressed the view that regulation is needed on fee disclosures and that consumers are harmed if they go through the reservation process and find out at the end that extra fees exist. A member of the public representing the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) expressed concern about the proposed rule\u2019s treatment of offline (i.e., telephone or in person) disclosures, and he urged the Department to make such offline disclosures available upon request or at the agent\u2019s discretion. A member of the public representing the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) stated that aggregators such as metasearch entities should not be subject to the rule. On the issue of data distribution to ticket agents, the IATA representative noted that his organization supports the Department\u2019s proposal not to mandate that airlines distribute fee information to ticket agents through GDSs, but that the costs of implementing the data sharing proposal within the six-month compliance period would be significant. Multiple members of the public representing ticket agents and GDSs expressed the view that the Department should require airlines to distribute fee information to GDSs and disagreed with what they saw as GDSs being excluded from the proposal. In their view, GDSs were the most efficient method to move data from airlines to ticket agents, and that without using GDSs, ticket agents would have to bear resource-intensive costs to enter into agreements with airlines and to make data visible to customers. Speakers at the December 8 meeting expressed differing views on whether the proposed compliance period of six months would be feasible, with the ACPAC\u2019s consumer representative stating that six months was not unrealistic given that capabilities exist for GDSs to provide the data necessary for ticket agents to comply, while speakers representing airlines and ticket agents asserted that six months was insufficient time, although acknowledging that the use of GDSs to transfer data could enable the proposed requirements to be implemented more quickly than not using GDSs. On January 12, 2023, the ACPAC publicly deliberated and voted on recommendations related to ancillary fees.46 The ACPAC recommendations concerned the types of ancillary service fees that should be disclosed, the manner and form of the disclosures (e.g., whether pop ups, roll overs, or links are acceptable), the timing of the disclosures, the application of fee disclosures to telephone or in-person inquiries, the ability for consumers to opt out of receiving the disclosures, the transactability of ancillary fees, the process for data sharing by airlines to ticket agents, the entities covered, and the appropriate compliance timeframes. On January 23, 2023, to facilitate the public\u2019s consideration of this NPRM, the Department publicly posted a written summary of the recommendations adopted by the ACPAC at its January 12 meeting.47 The ACPAC\u2019s specific recommendations are discussed in section E, where the Department discusses these matters in substance. (3) Public Hearing Regarding Proposals Under 14 CFR 399.75, when the Department issues a proposed regulation declaring a practice in air transportation or the sale of air transportation to be unfair or deceptive to consumers under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 41712(a), any interested party may file a petition to hold a hearing on the proposed regulation. Section 399.75 further provides that the petition for a hearing shall be granted if the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing that granting the petition is in the public interest. Factors in determining whether a petition is in the public interest include, but are not limited to: (i) Whether the proposed rule depends on conclusions concerning one or more specific scientific, technical, economic, or other factual issues that are genuinely in dispute or that may not satisfy the requirements of the Information Quality Act; (ii) Whether the ordinary public comment process is unlikely to provide an adequate examination of the issues to permit a fully informed judgment; (iii) Whether the resolution of the disputed factual issues 46 The committee voted in favor of moving forward with deliberation and issuing recommendations at the January 12, 2023, meeting, with the member representing airlines voting against moving forward while the NPRM\u2019s comment period remained open. The meeting minutes are available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT- OST-2018-0190-0111. 47 See Procedural Information Regarding Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees (January 23, 2023) at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AncillaryFeeNPRM-Procedural-Information-January23-2023. would likely have a material effect on the costs and benefits of the proposed rule; (iv) Whether the requested hearing would advance the consideration of the proposed rule and the General Counsel\u2019s ability to make the rulemaking determinations required by this section; and (v) Whether the hearing would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking. On January 23, 2023, three commenters petitioned the Department for a public hearing on the NPRM. Airlines for America (A4A) raised two questions in its petition: (1) whether consumers are or are likely to be substantially injured or are misled by airlines\u2019 current disclosures of ancillary service fees; and (2) whether disclosures of itinerary-specific ancillary fees at the time of first search will result in the display of incomplete or inapplicable ancillary fee information, cause consumer confusion, and distort the marketplace. The Travel Technology Association (Travel Tech) stated in its petition that there is a fundamental disputed factual issue as to whether the proposed display requirements would benefit or harm consumers. Travel Tech also expressed the belief that the proposed disclosures are technically infeasible and requested a hearing to discuss these concerns as well as the Department\u2019s proposed time frame for compliance. In its comment on the NPRM, Google LLC also requested a hearing based on its assertion that the Department\u2019s analysis was flawed and that it was deficient in providing complaint-based evidence justifying the rulemaking. In arguing that a hearing is in the public interest pursuant to 14 CFR 399.75, A4A and Travel Tech asserted that each of the criteria in 14 CFR 399.75 for determining whether a hearing was in the public interest and must therefore be granted had been met. The Department granted the public hearing to afford stakeholders an opportunity, in addition to the public comment process, to present factual issues that they believe are pertinent to the Department\u2019s decision on the rulemaking.48 The hearing was held on March 30, 2023,49 and a video recording of the full hearing was posted to the Department\u2019s website.50 48 88 FR 13389 (Mar. 3, 2023). 49 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023). The Department granted a postponement to the hearing\u2019s originally scheduled date of March 16, 2023, due to concerns by A4A and Travel Tech that the original 15 days\u2019 notice was insufficient to identify speakers and to compile data responsive to the subjects presented in the March 3 notice. A4A also stated that it would have difficulty finding participants due to the hearing being scheduled during the Spring Break season. 50 https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/AirlineAncillaryFeeNPRM/March30_Public_Hearing_Recording. Before the hearing, A4A raised objections about the designated Hearing Officer appointed by the Department.51 The organization made a request for the appointment of a hearing officer that would be \u201cneutral,\u201d rather than the Department\u2019s designated Aviation Consumer Advocate. Under the Department\u2019s regulation, the designation of a hearing officer is left to the discretion of the General Counsel.52 The duty of the hearing officer is to preside over the hearing and to place the hearing minutes in the docket. The General Counsel, not the hearing officer, determines the Department\u2019s actions following a hearing.53 In addition, the Department stated in a Federal Register document54 that the appointment was appropriate because: (1) the designated hearing officer is a career civil servant who will execute the role in a neutral, fair, and professional manner; (2) the designated hearing officer\u2019s responsibilities as an Aviation Consumer Advocate are the same responsibilities that this individual has as an Assistant General Counsel of the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection and such responsibilities do not result in bias; and (3) the Hearing Officer\u2019s role is to conduct the meeting using generally accepted meeting management techniques and to not serve as a decisionmaker. As such, the Department proceeded with its appointment of the Department\u2019s designated Aviation Consumer Advocate as the hearing officer for the March 30, 2023, hearing. A4A also objected to the second subject discussed at the hearing, \u201cwhether disclosures of itinerary-specific ancillary fees at the time of first search will result in the display of incomplete or inapplicable ancillary fee information, cause consumer confusion, and distort the marketplace.\u201d55 A4A stated that, in advance of the hearing, the Department asked the public for information on current carrier and ticket agent practices, including how ancillary fee information is currently displayed, how many existing online booking systems do not display specific ancillary fees on itinerary search result pages but display ancillary fees on other pages of the 51 https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0718. 52 14 CFR 399.75(b)(5)(ii). 53 14 CFR 399.75(b)(6). 54 88 FR 15622 (Mar. 14, 2023). 55 This subject was offered by A4A in its petition for a public hearing. See https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0091. booking process, whether the lack of ancillary fee information at the time of itinerary and fare selection for current systems results in higher total trip costs, and information from consumers on the time spent searching on current carrier or ticket agent websites. A4A asserted that these questions did not address A4A\u2019s intent in presenting the second subject of the hearing, which A4A explained was the impact of the Department\u2019s proposals on consumers. A4A stated that the failure to address this issue rendered the hearing ineffective. The Department disagrees with A4A\u2019s assertions that the public hearing failed to address the issue A4A posed for discussion and that the hearing was ineffective. In its notice announcing the public hearing,56 the Department stated that it welcomed, for issue 2, \u201cdata and information regarding any potential for consumer confusion from overcrowded displays or information overload that could result from the Department\u2019s proposal, particularly on mobile or other devices with smaller displays.\u201d The Department also solicited \u201cany other information that is pertinent to the Department\u2019s determination on this proposal.\u201d These requests for information are aligned with A4A\u2019s stated focus of the hearing\u2019s second subject and did not render the hearing ineffective. As provided in 14 CFR 399.75, following the completion of the hearing process, the General Counsel shall consider the record of the hearing, and shall make a reasoned determination whether to terminate the rulemaking; to proceed with the rulemaking as proposed; or to modify the proposed rule. Based on the record in this rulemaking proceeding, including the comments submitted by members of the public, the recommendations of the ACPAC, and the information received during the public hearing, the Acting General Counsel has determined that the Department should proceed with the rulemaking. The Department has made several adjustments that reflect the public input received, as discussed in section E. 56 88 FR 13389 (Mar. 3, 2023), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/03/2023- 04510/enhancing-transparency-of-airline-ancillary-service-fees. D. Statutory Authority (1) Unfair and Deceptive Practices The Department is implementing the revised regulatory requirements in this rule pursuant to its statutory authority in 49 U.S.C. 41712 to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation and the sale of air transportation. Under section 41712, a practice is \u201cunfair\u201d to consumers if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.57 A practice is \u201cdeceptive\u201d to consumers if it is likely to mislead a consumer, acting reasonably under the circumstances, with respect to a material matter. A matter is material if it is likely to have affected the consumer\u2019s conduct or decision with respect to a product or service.58 Proof of intent is not necessary to establish unfairness or deception.59 The elements of unfair and deceptive are further elaborated by the Department in its guidance document.60 In the NPRM, the Department tentatively determined that several practices conducted by airlines and ticket agents were unfair and deceptive in air transportation or the sale of air transportation. Members of the public provided input on the Department\u2019s preliminary determinations, including through submission of written comments and statements made at public meetings (i.e., ACPAC meetings and the March 30, 2023, public hearing). After fully considering the public input, the Department has concluded that the practices identified below are unfair and deceptive. (a) Bag Fees and Policies Pursuant to its authority under section 41712, the Department is requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag whenever fare and schedule information is provided to a consumer in response to a passenger-specific or 57 14 CFR 399.79(b)(1). 58 14 CFR 399.79(b)(2). 59 14 CFR 399.79(c). 60 87 FR 52677 (Aug. 28, 2022) anonymous itinerary search. The Department is also requiring disclosure of the applicable weight and dimensions of the first checked bag, second checked bag, and a carry-on bag before ticket purchase on an online platform. (i) Carriers The Department has concluded that a carrier commits an unfair and deceptive practice in the sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search without providing accompanying information on applicable fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag and when it fails to disclose weight and dimension information for that baggage before ticket purchase on an online platform. Regarding fees, the Department has heard from consumers and other stakeholders that such fees, which had once been included in the airfare but may now be broken out from the airfare depending on the airline, route, fare class, or other factors, are often difficult to ascertain during the itinerary search and ticket purchase process. We find that the practice of not disclosing first and second checked bag and carry-on bag fees with the quoted airfare at the time of an itinerary search during the ticket purchase process prevents consumers from knowing the true cost of their tickets, and that the practice may cause consumers to invest time pursuing a ticket purchase based on an appealing airfare that ends up resulting in less favorable overall costs to the consumer when baggage fees are added. Under this rule, the bag fees disclosed must be passenger-specific fees if a passenger affirmatively provides information such as the passenger\u2019s status in the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, the passenger\u2019s military status, or the passenger\u2019s status as a holder of a particular credit card. If the passenger does not affirmatively provide passenger-specific information, then the carrier must provide itinerary-specific fees, which would apply to the anonymous shopper, taking into account geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class (e.g., full fare ticket). The failure to disclose either passenger-specific or itinerary-specific bag fees with the quoted airfare at the time of an itinerary search is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The substantial injury this practice is likely to cause is the additional time spent searching to find the total cost of travel and any additional funds spent on air transportation that might have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up front and readily select the best price. This harm is not reasonably avoidable even with the disclosures mandated in the 2011 rulemaking that improved consumer access to first and second checked bag and carry-on bag fee information by requiring those fees to be displayed on airlines\u2019 websites. Airlines often disclose bag fees in an untailored, static format or in complex charts that are confusing to consumers and not readily available when consumers need the information to consider whether an itinerary and price offering best suits their needs. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because consumer confusion about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, competition and creates less than optimal purchasing decisions by consumers. In addition, because existing disclosure requirements of baggage fees did not apply to online platforms other than websites, consumers who searched for air transportation on those platforms may not have received the baggage fee information that this final rule now requires. The Department has determined that the disclosure of passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary-specific fees whenever fare and schedule information is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The practice of not disclosing passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary-specific fees for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags when fare and schedule information is provided is also deceptive in that it misleads consumers into believing the total purchase price from one carrier for a particular itinerary or fare type is cheaper than that of another when that may not be the case. This belief is reasonable as carriers and agents often disclose only the airfare and not bag fees during an itinerary search. As carriers have different policies regarding the fees and limitations imposed to transport baggage, and because variation within each carrier depends on the fare category purchased or the status of the passenger, the current requirement that carriers inform consumers that fees for baggage may apply and where consumers can see these baggage fees during the booking process is not providing consumers sufficient notice of the total cost of the air transportation. Consumers are often diverted to complex charts that are confusing, prolong the consumer\u2019s process of evaluating itineraries and fares for purchase, and may ultimately not be instructive for many consumers in determining the bag fee that would apply to them. The cost of the first and second checked bag and carry-on bag is often material to consumers, as knowing such costs in conjunction with the ticket price is likely to affect the consumer\u2019s purchase decisions as well as whether to check or carry-on a bag.61 The Department has also determined that it is an unfair practice to not disclose on an online platform the applicable weight and dimension allowances of a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag, adjusted based on passenger-specific information if information specific to the passenger has been affirmatively provided. However, the Department is of the view that, unlike fees, it is sufficient to provide weight and dimension allowances of a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag before ticket purchase to avoid engaging in an unfair and deceptive practice. The Department agrees with the comments, which are discussed in section E (4)(b), that providing the policy information is less critical to consumers\u2019 decision making than the fees themselves; accordingly, the Department is allowing disclosure of these policies later in the ticket purchase process. Nevertheless, the practice of not disclosing applicable weight and dimension allowances is likely to also cause substantial injury to consumers if not disclosed prior to ticket purchase given airlines\u2019 policies on bag size vary and consumers who learn that the weight and dimensions allowances of the selected carrier are stricter than the common bag size may decide to select a different carrier. This harm is not 61 As noted in the NPRM, the GAO found that since airlines first imposed checked baggage fees, the number of checked bags per passenger has declined. GAO also explains that checked baggage fees have led to greater amounts of carry-on baggage. GAO 10-785, Commercial Aviation: Consumers Could Benefit from Better Information about Airline-Imposed Fees and Refundability of Government-Imposed Taxes and Fees (July 14, 2010) at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-10-785.pdf. reasonably avoidable because, even though existing regulations require the disclosure of this information on e-ticket confirmations, this disclosure is provided after ticket purchase, thereby depriving consumers of the ability to fully evaluate potentially better options for them prior to ticket purchase. There is no countervailing benefit to consumers or competition from the practice of not disclosing weight and dimension allowances of baggage before ticket purchase, as the lack of information to consumers reduces their ability to evaluate ticket purchases and harms competition. (ii) Ticket Agents The Department has concluded that a ticket agent commits an unfair and deceptive practice in the sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search without providing accompanying information on applicable fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag and when it fails to provide weight and dimension information for that baggage before ticket purchase on an online platform. As noted above, the Department has heard from consumers and other stakeholders that baggage fees are often difficult to ascertain during the itinerary search and ticket purchase process. This difficulty is exacerbated on ticket agent channels in many cases, given the numerous airline and itinerary options presented. We find that the practice of not disclosing baggage fees with the quoted airfare at the time of an itinerary search prevents consumers from knowing the true cost of their air tickets, and that the practice may cause consumers to invest time pursuing a ticket purchase based on an appealing airfare that ends up resulting in less favorable overall costs to the consumer when baggage fees are later added. The failure to disclose bag fees with the quoted airfare at the time of an itinerary search is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The substantial injury this practice is likely to cause is the additional time spent searching to find the total cost of travel and any additional funds spent on air transportation that might have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up front and readily select the best price. This harm is not reasonably avoidable, as described regarding carriers in section D (1)(a)(i). In addition, ticket agents provide a means for consumers to evaluate different travel options, often on different airlines. The harm of increased time and costs involved in the ticket purchase process is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because consumer confusion about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, competition and creates less than optimal purchasing decisions by consumers. The Department has determined that the disclosure of passenger-specific fees whenever fare and schedule information is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The practice of not disclosing passenger-specific fees for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags when fare and schedule information is provided is also deceptive in that it misleads consumers into believing the total purchase price from one carrier for a particular itinerary or fare type is cheaper than that of another when that may not be the case. This belief is reasonable as ticket agents often disclose only the airfare and not bag fees during an itinerary search. The current requirement that ticket agents provide a generic notice that \u201cfees for baggage may apply\u201d during the booking process is not providing consumers sufficient notice of the total cost of the air transportation. Although existing regulations require carriers and ticket agents to inform consumers during the booking process about where consumers can see baggage fees, ticket agents may refer consumers to the carrier\u2019s website to search for fees, which would necessitate the consumer leaving the ticket agent\u2019s website, prolonging the consumer\u2019s process of evaluating itineraries and fares for purchase. The cost of the first and second checked bag and carry-on bag is often material to consumers, as knowing such costs in conjunction with the ticket price is likely to affect the consumer\u2019s purchase decisions. The failure to disclose the applicable weight and dimension allowances of a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag, adjusted based on passenger-specific information affirmatively provided by the consumer, is also an unfair practice. The Department has decided to require disclosure of these weight and dimension allowances before ticket purchase, rather than during the itinerary search process like bag fees, because the Department has been persuaded by commenters that providing this information is less critical to consumers\u2019 decision making than the fees themselves. This practice is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers given airlines\u2019 policies on bag size vary and consumers may have to pay more to transport their bags because of high airline fees for oversized or overweight bags than would have been the case if they knew the weight and dimensions allowances prior to ticket purchase and selected a different carrier with a bag size and dimension allowance that suited their circumstances. This harm is not reasonably avoidable, because even though existing regulations require the disclosure of this information on e-ticket confirmations, the disclosure is provided after ticket purchase, thereby depriving consumers of the ability to fully evaluate the cost of their ticket before purchase. There is no countervailing benefit to consumers or competition from the practice of not disclosing weight and dimension allowances of baggage before ticket purchase, as the lack of information to consumers reduces their ability to evaluate ticket purchases and harms competition. (b) Change and Cancellation Fees and Policies Pursuant to its authority under section 41712, the Department is requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees to change and cancel a ticket in response to a passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary-specific search and to disclose ticket change and cancellation policies before a consumer\u2019s purchase of air transportation on an online platform. (i) Carriers The Department concludes that a carrier commits an unfair practice in the sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search without providing accompanying information on applicable change and cancellation fees and fails to provide change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform. The practice is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The Department currently requires the disclosure of these fees on or with the ticket.62 This requirement, however, means that consumers often receive information about these fees after the purchase of the ticket is already made (i.e., upon receipt of the ticket confirmation), which the Department determines in this final rule is not sufficient disclosure. The practice of not disclosing these fees while consumers select an itinerary and fare causes substantial injury to consumers in that passengers may not be aware of the change and cancellation fees that apply to a particular fare being offered, and they may then select a fare without adequate notice that they could incur significant fees to change or cancel their tickets. These harms are not reasonably avoidable if the carrier does not provide disclosures on its cancellation or change fees during the itinerary search process and policies before ticket purchase on an online platform. Although carriers are already required to have change and cancellation policy and fee information available on their websites, the existing rule allows carriers to provide the fee information in a range. Consumers are harmed when they do not know the specific change or cancellation fee that would apply to them during the itinerary search process, particularly when the ranges provided by some carriers are so wide as to be virtually useless.63 Consumers may also find it difficult to ascertain the change, cancellation, and refund policies that apply to the specific ticket they are selecting if the airline does not disclose such information during the booking process. Moreover, change fees, even if not in a range, and change and cancellation policies may not be simple to understand, as fare categories, passenger status, ticket type (e.g., award ticket purchases), and other factors may impact the applicable 62 See 14 CFR 253.7. 63 See, e.g., United Airlines, Upgrades and Optional Service Charges (original page accessed Feb. 29, 2024) (showing \u201cOther Flight Changes and Cancellations\u201d as \u201c$0 to $1,000 per traveler, based on applicable fare rules\u201d); Delta Air Lines, Change or Cancel Overview (original page accessed Feb. 29, 2024) (showing potential change and cancellation fees of \u201c$0-400\u201d for non-refundable fares); American Airlines, Optional Service Fees (original page accessed Feb. 29, 2024) (showing change fees of \u201cup to $750\u201d). Website screenshots available in docket at https://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2022-0109. change and cancellation fees and policies. Further, because the cancellation and change fee information is not provided during the itinerary-search process, consumers would need to interrupt their booking process to search for the information and extend the time needed to complete a booking. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because, like baggage fees and dimensions, consumer surprise or confusion about applicable change and cancellation fees and policies harms, rather than benefits, competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger-specific or non- passenger-specific change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search process would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. In addition, consumers are substantially harmed if they are not provided the following additional disclosures about change and cancellation policies before purchase on an online platform: (1) any prohibitions or  that limit a consumer\u2019s ability to change or cancel a ticket; (2) whether the consumer\u2019s reservation can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase without penalty or whether it can be held at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, provided the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight\u2019s departure;64 (3) the form of the refund or credit that would be provided; (4) that the consumer is responsible for any fare differential on a changed ticket, if applicable; and (5) whether the consumer will receive a refund of the difference in fare if the consumer changes their flight and selects a less costly replacement flight. Disclosure of change and cancellation policy , such as whether the consumer would be required to pay a fare differential for a ticket change and whether the consumer can receive a refund in the original form of payment, may impact the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase the selected itinerary or wait until the consumer is more certain of their travel plans. While important, these disclosures of the details of the change and cancellation policies are less critical at the time of itinerary search than the change and cancellation fees themselves. 64 This rule requires that the carrier disclose its 24-hour cancellation or hold policy on the last page of the booking process as this is the point in the purchase process at which this disclosure is most relevant to consumers. Accordingly, the Department is of the view that, unlike fees, it is sufficient to disclose change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase to avoid engaging in an unfair practice. The Department also concludes that the practice of not disclosing change and cancellation fees with an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search and change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform is deceptive. Without proper notice, consumers acting reasonably would be misled with respect to the change and cancellation fees and policies that apply to their ticket and may believe that changes or cancellations are possible at no fee or at a reduced fee. As noted above, many carriers changed their ticket change policies during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and such changes were publicly promoted by the carriers. A reasonable consumer may believe that he or she can change a ticket free of charge when that might not be the case, or he or she may choose to purchase a fare type that does not allow changes, believing erroneously that a change is allowed. Comments by consumer advocates and individuals suggest that consumers do consider change and cancellation fees and policies when making purchasing decisions, particularly during emergency situations such as a pandemic or potential severe weather events such as hurricane seasons.65 The change and cancellation fees and policies are therefore material because they could affect the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. As such, the Department concludes that the failure to disclose change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search process and change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform is deceptive. (ii) Ticket Agents The Department concludes that a ticket agent commits an unfair practice in the sale of air transportation when it discloses an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search without 65 See comments submitted in the docket for the 2014 NPRM, which can be accessed at https://www.regulations.gov/search?filter=DOT-OST-2014-0056. See also, e.g., Minutes or webcast (at 2:15:55) of the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, available at https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation- consumer-protection/aviation-consumer-protection-advisory-committee. providing accompanying information on applicable change and cancellation fees and fails to provide change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase on an online platform. The practice is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The Department currently requires that carriers disclose change and cancellation fees and policies on or with the ticket, but current regulations do not require ticket agents to disclose such fees and policies during the ticket purchase process. As such, consumers purchasing tickets from certain ticket agents may be unaware of the change and cancellation fees and policies that would apply to them if they were to proceed with the purchase of a ticket. The Department understands that a substantial number of consumers purchase their tickets through ticket agents.66 The practice of not disclosing these fees while consumers select an itinerary and fare causes substantial injury in that consumers may not be aware of the change and cancellation fees that apply to a particular fare being offered, and they may then select a fare without adequate notice that they could incur significant fees to change or cancel their tickets. In addition, consumers incur substantial injury if they are not provided the following disclosures about change and cancellation policies before purchase on an online platform: (1) any prohibitions or  that limit a consumer\u2019s ability to change or cancel a ticket; (2) whether the consumer\u2019s reservation can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase without penalty or whether it can be held at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, provided the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight\u2019s departure;67 (3) the form of the refund or credit that would be provided; (4) that the consumer is responsible for any fare differential, if applicable; and (5) whether the consumer will receive a refund of the difference in fare if the consumer changes 66 See, e.g., remarks by a representative of ASTA at the ACPAC\u2019s June 28, 2022, meeting. The representative stated that 44% of air tickets were sold by travel agencies (excluding OTAs), 39% were sold on airline websites, 12% were sold by OTAs, and 5% are sold through offline direct channels. Meeting minutes can be found at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0073. 67 This rule requires that the ticket agent disclose whether it has a 24-hour cancellation or hold policy on the last page of the booking process as this is the point in the purchase process at which this disclosure is most relevant to consumers. their flight and selects a less costly replacement flight. Disclosure of change and cancellation policy , such as whether the consumer would be required to pay a fare differential for a ticket change and whether the consumer can receive a refund in the original form of payment, may impact the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase the selected itinerary or wait until the consumer is more certain of their travel plans. While important, these disclosures of the details of the change and cancellation policies are less critical at the time of itinerary search than the change and cancellation fees themselves and any prohibitions on the ability to change and cancel a ticket, which must be disclosed at that point. Accordingly, the Department is of the view that, unlike fees, it is sufficient to disclose change and cancellation policies before ticket purchase to avoid engaging in an unfair and deceptive practice. These harms are not reasonably avoidable if the ticket agent does not provide disclosures on cancellation or change fees when it provides an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search and policy information before purchase on an online platform. Ticket agents often refer consumers to carrier webpages that contain fee information, but this information is allowed to be expressed as a range rather than a specific applicable number.68 This means that many consumers cannot determine the change and cancellation fees that would apply to them. Also, it is disruptive and time-consuming for consumers purchasing from ticket agents to navigate away from the ticket agents\u2019 online platform to the carrier\u2019s website to search for the information. Change and cancellation policies and fees may be difficult to understand, as fare categories, passenger status, ticket type (e.g., award ticket purchases), and other factors such as where the passenger is flying may impact the applicable change and cancellation fees and policies. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because, like baggage fees, consumer surprise or confusion about applicable change and cancellation fees after airfare purchase harms, rather than benefits, competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger- specific or non-passenger-specific change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search 68 See, e.g., fn. 61, above. process and policies before ticket purchase on an online platform would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The Department also concludes that the practice of not disclosing change and cancellation fees with an airfare in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search and policies before ticket purchase on an online platform to be deceptive. Without the required notice, consumers acting reasonably would be misled with respect to the change and cancellation fees and policies that apply to their ticket and may believe that changes or cancellations are possible at no fee or at a reduced fee. As noted above, many carriers changed their ticket change policies during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and such changes were publicly promoted by the carriers. A reasonable consumer may believe that his or her ticket may be changeable free of charge when that might not be the case, or he or she may choose to purchase a fare type that does not allow changes, believing erroneously that a change is permitted. Comments by consumer advocates and individuals suggested that consumers do consider change and cancellation fees and policies when making purchasing decisions, particularly during emergency situations such as a pandemic or potential severe weather events such as hurricane seasons. The change and cancellation fees and policies are therefore material because they could affect the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. As such, the Department concludes that the failure to disclose change and cancellation fees during the itinerary-search process and policies before ticket purchase on an online platform is deceptive. (c) Percentage-off Discounts After careful consideration of the comments submitted in this rulemaking, the Department has concluded that, when the  \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare\u201d are used in a percentage-off advertisement, it is an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to not apply the percentage off the total cost of the ticket. Additionally, the Department has concluded that, when the term \u201cbase fare\u201d is used in a percentage-off advertisement, it is an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to not apply the percentage off the full fare amount excluding all government taxes and charges. These types of percentage-off advertisements are deceptive as they mislead reasonable consumers on a material matter. A reasonable consumer seeing an advertisement for a 25% discount off a flight, a ticket, or a fare would believe that he or she is receiving 25% of the entire ticket based on a common understanding of those  as supported by comments discussed in section E. That reasonable consumer would be misled if he or she were to find out that the 25% off discount applied to only a portion of the ticket price. Similarly, a reasonable consumer seeing an advertisement for a 30% discount off a \u201cbase fare\u201d would believe that he or she is receiving 30% off the full fare excluding all government taxes and fees based on a common understanding of that term as supported by comments discussed in section E. That individual would be misled if he or she received a 30% off only a portion of the carrier-imposed mandatory charges. The percentage discounts are a material matter because they affect the price that consumers pay for the air transportation. These types of percentage-off advertisements are also unfair as they have potential to cause substantial harm to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Consumers may be substantially harmed because they are likely to encounter higher charges than expected if a seller advertises an appealing offer by stating \u201c50% off a flight\u201d or \u201c50% off a base fare\u201d so consumers will click on the advertisements only to find out that it is 50% off only a small portion of the ticket, which can multiply if a consumer relies on the promotional discount for multiple passengers on an itinerary or for an individual passenger traveling on a higher cost itinerary. The harm is not easily avoided due to a lack of clarity in the advertising language that carriers use. The harm that consumers experience from this practice is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because the lack of clarity about the offered fare harms, rather than promotes, competition. (d) Data Sharing This final rule requires U.S. and foreign air carriers to provide any entity required to disclose critical ancillary fee information directly to consumers useable, current, and accurate information of the fee rules for critical ancillary services if the carrier provides fare, schedule, and availability information to that entity. The information provided by carriers to these entities must be sufficient to ensure compliance with any applicable disclosure requirements. The failure of a carrier to provide critical ancillary fee information to entities required to disclose this information to consumers is an unfair practice. Approximately half of air travel tickets are sold by ticket agents.69 There is likely substantial harm to consumers if an entity required to disclose accurate critical ancillary fee information to consumers is unable to do so due to the carrier\u2019s failure to provide such information to that entity. Consumers are substantially harmed under these circumstances because consumers must then spend additional time searching to find the total cost of travel and consumers may spend additional funds on air transportation that could have been avoided if the consumer had the critical ancillary fee disclosed to them. This harm is not reasonably avoidable, as consumers would have to leave the ticket purchase process to review fees provided in each carrier website. In addition, once at a carrier website, consumers will likely not be able to determine the fee for changing and canceling a reservation as carriers provide that information in a range.70 Consumers will also likely have difficulty determining the fee for transporting a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and second checked bag because baggage fee structures are often complex and require charts and calculators to show the cost of fees. This harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition as the sharing of critical ancillary service fee information enables consumers to access critical ancillary fee information from a larger variety of ticket purchase vendors, which improves, rather than harms, competition. 69 ACPAC Meeting Minutes (June 28, 2022), p. 13 at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190- 0073. In its written comment, ASTA stated that 48 percent of total sales and aggregate spending were sold by travel agencies in 2019. https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0083. 70 See fn. 61 (showing that some airlines provide a large range for change or cancellation fees, with United, for example, quoting \u201c$0 to $1,000 per traveler\u201d). (e) Additional Unfair or Deceptive Practices Additional discussion of unfair and deceptive practices identified in this final rule is provided in sections E (1)(c) (failure of a carrier or ticket agent that sells air transportation to make critical ancillary fee disclosures at the first page of its website or other online platform to which a consumer is directed after searching for flights on a metasearch site where that information is not provided); E (3)(d) (failure of a carrier or ticket agent to disclose that the purchase of a seat is not required for travel particularly when consumers are provided seats to choose where many require a fee to reserve); E (10)(a) (failure of a ticket agent that sells air tour packages to disclose that additional baggage fees may apply when a passenger books an air tour package without an identifiable carrier and the failure to disclose the passenger-specific fees for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag when the carrier is known); and E (10)(c) (failure of a ticket agent to display baggage fees in text form on the e-ticket confirmation that has traditionally applied to carriers). (f) Stakeholder Comments and DOT Responses Comments: Airlines and airline associations disagreed with the Department\u2019s proposed determination that not providing fee disclosures at the beginning of the ticket purchase process was an unfair and deceptive practice. Several airline commenters asserted that the Department did not provide adequate justification that consumers experienced or would likely experience substantial injury, as required by the analysis of an unfair practice. Spirit Airlines asserted that it already displays ancillary fees during the booking process, and that 95% of its customers advance past baggage selection pages, showing that concerns about injury are unfounded. A4A stated, \u201cEvery A4A passenger air carrier displays or makes available at first search results the ancillary fee information that DOT proposes for a consumer conducting an anonymous search in the direct channel via rollovers or links.\u201d71 A4A also noted that the Department did not differentiate its unfair and deceptive practice analysis between airlines and ticket agents in the 71 Comment of A4A, pages 17-18, available at https://www.regulations.gov/comment/DOT-OST-2022-0109-0090. NPRM, and the organization asserted that the rulemaking should be withdrawn with respect to airlines because consumer harm was avoidable. A4A, IATA, the National Air Carrier Association (NACA), and others asserted that the number of ancillary fee consumer complaints cited by the Department was too small to conclude substantial harm, and that the complaints do not evidence a lack of transparency. IATA and other airline associations asserted that consumers already understand that ancillary services are available for a fee, and because they have information on fees before they purchase tickets, there is no substantial harm. Similar statements were made by airline representatives at the ACPAC meeting held on December 8, 2022. At that meeting, a representative of IATA stated that the Department did not provide evidence that consumers do not know the price imposed for baggage before purchasing a ticket. Airlines also asserted that the proscribed practices were not likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances, as required by the analysis of a deceptive practice. Multiple airlines noted, for example, that because ancillary fees are already on airline websites, it was not reasonable to conclude that the non-display of fees during the initial itinerary search was deceptive. A4A commented that the Department did not use the right standard for a consumer \u201cacting reasonably,\u201d as part of its deceptive practice analysis, and the organization asserted that the Department should instead use enforcement processes rather than rulemaking to address problematic fee disclosure practices. Individual commenters and multiple State attorneys general asserted that airlines were treating consumers unfairly regarding fees and that consumers were likely to be misled by current disclosures. Some of these individual commenters expressed frustration about the ticket purchase process, noting that when they attempt to buy a ticket they view as being a particular cost, the total cost increases when fees are later added. One commenter noted that some consumers would realize they could not afford the total cost of a trip had they known about bag fees when they selected their ticket. One commenter noted that it would be extremely rare for a passenger to travel without any baggage at all. Another commenter self-identified as a frequent traveler and stated that understanding and paying for ancillary fees was confusing and frustrating, particularly on third-party applications. Multiple State attorneys general commented that they hear every day from consumers who are deceived by \u201cjunk fees\u201d and have launched education campaigns to protect consumers from hidden fees, junk fees, and drip pricing. The State attorneys general also noted that their offices receive numerous complaints about airlines\u2019 lack of disclosures of baggage and change and cancellation fees. FlyersRights stated that because airlines have increased the number and cost of ancillary fees, consumers are misled into believing that the cost of air travel will be cheaper than it is. The organization added that ancillary fees are often necessary for travel and used to be included in the base fare. The Department received mixed comments from ticket agent representatives on its assertion that it is an unfair and deceptive practice not to provide disclosure of critical ancillary service fees before ticket purchase. The United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA) commented that the Department did not adequately demonstrate consumer harm, adding that consumers are aware that there are baggage fees and that there were few consumer complaints. As a metasearch entity, Google expressed its view that the Department did not explain how consumers were harmed by not having fee disclosures until the ticket purchase stage of the booking process and that consumers are aware of fees. Google also noted that the Department\u2019s sampling of consumer complaints did not show that the fee was not disclosed, but that consumers were surprised by the amount of the fees or the applicability of fees. However, ASTA commented that consumers are confused from airlines\u2019 unbundling their ancillary services, and that ancillary service fees remain difficult for consumers to discover and are hard to understand when they are found. ASTA added that ancillary fees are revealed too late in the search process to permit effective comparison shopping. Skyscanner stated that it shared the goal of enhancing competition and avoiding the unfair and deceptive practice of failing to inform consumers of the full cost of travel. Ticket agents also commented on ensuring that they had access to ancillary fee data from airlines. One ticket agent commenter noted that consumers using third-party websites to purchase tickets may not have access to fee data and that lack of data provisioning is an unfair and deceptive practice. One metasearch entity commented that requiring data sharing with metasearch companies would reduce the risk that the transportation will be sold to consumers in an unfair or deceptive manner. As for airlines\u2019 view on data sharing, at the ACPAC meeting held on December 8, 2022, the airline representative noted the Department did not provide an unfair and deceptive practice analysis for its proposal on the sharing of fee information to ticket agents. DOT Response: The Department has carefully considered the public comments on this issue and has determined that the practices identified in this rulemaking meet the elements of an unfair and deceptive practice. Those entities opposing the Department\u2019s position generally asserted that the Department did not provide sufficient evidence of substantial injury, that the Department relied on a small number of consumer complaints, that the consumer harm is avoidable as the fees are presented on airline websites, and that consumers are aware that ancillary fees exist. Other comments opposing the Department\u2019s position stated that consumers are not interested in ancillary fees when booking tickets and that the Department did not conduct an unfair and deceptive practice analysis regarding its data-sharing proposal. The Department disagrees that there is insufficient evidence of substantial injury. Consumer complaints are only one metric that the Department uses to gauge whether an unfair or deceptive practice is occurring. The Department also relies on the statements of consumer advocates, all of which have consistently expressed concern about consumer confusion over ancillary fees throughout the years that rulemaking has been contemplated on this subject. The Department finds it reasonable to rely on the statements of the many consumer advocates, State attorneys general, and consumer organizations as representative of the views of consumers, and, when further confirmed by consumer complaints, to determine that substantial harm is occurring or is likely to occur. These positions by consumers were reaffirmed in their comments to the NPRM. Comments submitted by members of the public in this rulemaking also clearly evidence that consumers are surprised by the amount of ancillary fees charged when they purchase tickets. The Department also disagrees that the consumer harm is reasonably avoidable. While the fees for baggage and other ancillary services are provided on airline websites, such fees are not disclosed on ticket agent websites and are difficult to ascertain prior to ticket purchase. Ancillary fees, except for baggage, may be expressed in a range, and baggage fee structures are often complex and require charts and calculators to show the cost of fees. Some fees may also not be applicable to passengers who purchase tickets on one airline\u2019s website for flights that will be operated by a different airline. The Department also disagrees with the premise that consumers are well-informed about airline fees. While many consumers may be aware of the existence of fees, a large number of consumers do not know the amount of the fees that will apply to them, given the complexity of fee structures. Comments from consumers affirm this belief, and Google and others acknowledged this fact in their comments. Having fee disclosures up front during the booking process would mitigate the consumer surprise at the level of fees to be imposed. The Department disagrees with the assertion that consumers not purchasing baggage fees during ticket purchase (or otherwise skipping pages that disclose baggage information) is indicative that they are not interested in baggage fees. Consumer advocates and commenters have noted that baggage is a critical ancillary service, and the decision not to purchase baggage services during the ticket purchase process does not mean that the consumer will not purchase a bag later or that the amount of the fee is not important to the consumer. Regarding the airline representative\u2019s statement at the December 8, 2022, ACPAC meeting that the Department did not conduct an unfair or deceptive analysis of the data sharing proposal in the NPRM, the Department has determined in this final rule that failure to disclose baggage and change and cancellation fees to consumers as specified in the rule is an unfair and deceptive practice. The Department has also determined that the failure for a carrier to provide critical ancillary fee information to any entity required to disclose this information to consumers that displays or sells the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers to be an unfair practice. The Department\u2019s analysis complies with its regulations, which require an analysis supporting a conclusion that a practice is unfair or deceptive to consumers pursuant to 14 CFR 399.75(c). At the ACPAC meeting, the Department responded to the airline representative by noting that data sharing is related to the disclosure of fees because, without data sharing, the disclosure of fees would not be possible for a large segment of consumers. The Department provides its analysis of how the failure to share critical ancillary fee information is an unfair practice in section D (1)(d). Finally, the Department disagrees with the suggestion that it should pursue enforcement action under its unfair and deceptive practices authority, rather than conducting a rulemaking. As stated by the Department at the December 8, 2022, ACPAC meeting, the airline representative\u2019s suggestion that the Department take enforcement action instead of conducting rulemaking would be difficult if the current regulation permits or does not address the practices that are of concern. The Department issues this regulation to address the inadequacy in the current regulation. (2) Other Authorities In carrying out aviation economic programs, including issuing this final rule under 49 U.S.C. 41712, the Department is required to consider the factors identified in 49 U.S.C. 40101 as being in the public interest and consistent with public convenience and necessity. Under 49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4), the Department is required to consider the availability of a variety of adequate, economic, efficient, and low-priced services without unreasonable discrimination or unfair or deceptive practices as being in the public interest. Under section 40101(a)(9), it is also in the public interest to prevent unfair, deceptive, predatory, or anticompetitive practices in air transportation. The Department is also required by section 40101(a)(12) to consider as being in the public interest encouraging, developing, and maintaining an air transportation system relying on actual and potential competition to provide efficiency, innovation, and low prices. Except for Southwest Airlines, airline commenters generally asserted that the Department\u2019s rulemaking would harm competition by, in their view, making it more difficult for consumers to view travel options. Ultra low-cost carriers also believed that the rule would undermine their business model of unbundling ancillary services from the cost of airfare. Airlines expressed the view that the popularity of unbundled offerings showed that consumers preferred those models and not that they were being deceived. Southwest Airlines stated that the number and complexity of fees by airlines made comparison shopping more difficult, and it commented that it was appropriate for the Department to reduce the complexity of disclosures. Some ticket agents such as USTOA and metasearch entities such as Google stated that the existing marketplace provided transparency and that the rule would diminish consumer choice and competition. In contrast, others such as ASTA commented that ancillary service fees are not accessible in a timely manner and that identifying the total travel cost is complex, confusing, and needlessly time-consuming for consumers. Travel Tech noted that, because ticket agents do not universally receive information on critical ancillary service fees from airlines, some ticket agents are currently unable to display those fees at any point in the booking process. Skyscanner commented that it strongly supports the Department\u2019s goal of making critical ancillary fees more transparent for consumers. Some ticket agents also noted that a lack of transactability of ancillary fees on ticket agent websites would disincentivize consumers from purchasing air travel on those websites. Consumers generally stated that the rule would facilitate price comparison, encourage competition, and prevent airlines from using hidden fees to gain an unfair advantage. Consumer advocacy groups asserted that market competition requires transparency and informed consumers, with consumers benefiting from the availability of reliable fee information from multiple sources. One individual stated that the rule would reduce options and make travel less affordable. After considering the public comments, the Department has determined that this rule serves the public interest as articulated above. This rule improves the transparency of airline pricing through the increased disclosure of fees for critical ancillary services during the itinerary search process. As carriers vary on their policies for such fees and such information is often not provided during the purchase process, consumers of air transportation may have difficulty understanding the actual and potential costs of accessing the air transportation between different carriers. By improving this transparency, this rule allows for better understanding of airline ticket pricing, of which these fees are often a critical component, thereby encouraging price competition. The Department acknowledges concern about screen clutter and a potential reduction in travel options being displayed to consumers; as such, the Department has adjusted its disclosure requirements from those proposed in the NPRM to allow for more flexibility in the manner of display of information and to reduce the potential for the harms identified by the commenters. To answer the concerns of carriers, the Department believes that this rule does not undermine the business model of unbundled offerings. The rule does not prohibit such a model, and by improving the disclosure of fees associated with ancillary services, the Department believes that the rule helps to improve the model by making it more transparent to consumers. We do note that the unbundled model has proliferated in the marketplace, but we do not agree with commenters\u2019 assertion that this is evidence that the model is preferred by consumers and not that they are being deceived by airlines\u2019 current disclosure practices. The Department has presented its analysis of how a failure of carriers or tickets agents to provide the disclosures required in this final rule represents an unfair or deceptive practice. We are also not persuaded by ticket agents\u2019 concern that a lack of transactability of ancillary fees would disincentivize purchases on ticket agents\u2019 websites. As noted in sections E (3)(c) and E (7), this final rule does not require the disclosure or transactability of family seating fees. The Department is considering issues related to family seating in a separate rulemaking.72 This rule also does not require ticket agents to make the fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag transactable on ticket agent websites. Due to the post purchase price increase prohibition in 14 CFR 399.88, airlines are currently prevented from increasing the baggage fees that apply to a consumer\u2019s booking after the time of the consumer\u2019s ticket purchase. We have seen little evidence that consumers are choosing to forgo using ticket agent websites as a direct result of not being able to purchase baggage fees on those websites. These circumstances have predated this rule, and the Department does not believe that the addition of new critical ancillary fee disclosures during the purchase process will change that behavior. E. Comments and DOT Responses (1) Covered Entities The Department proposed to cover U.S. air carriers; foreign air carriers; ticket agents that sell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agents, or OTAs; and metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers. The Department proposed that GDSs would not be covered by the proposal as GDSs arrange for air transportation but do not sell or display a carrier\u2019s fare to consumers. This final rule covers U.S. and foreign air carriers as proposed. It also covers ticket agents that sell or display airline tickets, except for corporate travel agents, which are excluded from coverage for the reasons explained later in this document. This rule does not make a determination on whether metasearch entities and aggregators that advertise, but do not sell, airline tickets, are ticket agents and would thus be covered by this rule. However, if the Department were to determine in a separate rulemaking73 that metasearch entities and 72 See https://www.transportation.gov/regulations/report-on-significant-rulemakings. 73 Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57), (abstract explains that this rulemaking would address whether to codify in regulation a definition of \u201cticket agent\u201d and whether to require large ticket agents to adopt minimum customer service standards), Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Action at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105- AE57. aggregators are ticket agents as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(45), then they would be covered by this rule as well.74 The Department\u2019s response to comments about which entities should be covered by this final rule and explanations for all modifications from the NPRM are described in the sections that follow. Discussion of which operations and online platforms of covered entities are covered by this final rule is provided in section E (2). (a) U.S. and Foreign Air Carriers Proposal: The Department proposed fee and policy disclosure of critical ancillary services by U.S. and foreign carriers during the booking process when fare and schedule information is provided. In addition, the Department proposed to require that the carriers provide the fee information for critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display the airlines\u2019 fare and schedule information. Comments: A4A stated that \u201cDOT data does not demonstrate the existence of any significant problems with airline ancillary-fee transparency, and therefore this NPRM as applied to airlines should be withdrawn.\u201d According to A4A, the regulation of airlines is unnecessary because airlines already disclose fees for critical ancillary services. A4A added that any unfair or deceptive practices occur on indirect channels (e.g., OTAs, metasearch sites, \u201ctraditional\u201d travel agencies, and travel management companies). An individual commenter stated that the rule appeared to be focused on problems with disclosures by large U.S. carriers, suggesting that the rule should not cover other entities like foreign carriers and small network carriers. DOT Response: This final rule covers U.S. and foreign air carriers because the issue of lack of transparency of airline ancillary service fees is not limited to indirect channels as asserted by airline commenters or limited to large U.S. carriers as suggested by an individual commenter. The Department wants to ensure that consumers know, when fare and schedule information is provided during the booking process, the fees charged for transporting a first and second checked 74 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(45) defines a ticket agent as \u201ca person (except an air carrier, a foreign air carrier, or an employee of an air carrier or foreign air carrier) that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out as selling, providing, or arranging for, air transportation.\u201d bag, transporting a carry-on bag, and canceling or changing a flight whether they are purchasing the ticket from an airline or a ticket agent. Approximately 45% of tickets are sold by airlines directly to consumers, and the remainder is sold through ticket agents,75 so it is important to cover not only ticket agents but also carriers. Further, it is important to ensure that consumers purchasing air transportation from small carriers or foreign air carriers that fly to and from the U.S. are protected from unfair and deceptive practices equal to those purchasing tickets from U.S. carriers and ticket agents. Accordingly, as discussed in section D, the unfair and deceptive practices that the Department is addressing in this final rule relate to ticket agents and carriers regardless of the carrier\u2019s size or country affiliation for flights to, within, and from the U.S. (b) Ticket Agents that Sell Air Transportation Proposal: The Department proposed to require all ticket agents that sell air transportation, including corporate travel agents, to disclose to consumers the fees and policies for ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. The Department solicited comments in the NPRM on whether it should exclude corporate travel agents from coverage of the final rule because the display content for such agents is typically negotiated by the business client involved. Comments: The Department\u2019s proposal to apply the transparency requirements regarding critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell air transportation was challenged only as it relates to corporate travel agents and small ticket agents. Consumer groups, including the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, generally supported covering ticket agents. An individual commenter asked the Department to clarify that OTAs have responsibility for the disclosure of ancillary fees provided on their websites because carriers lack control over the display of information on those sites. Some airlines and organizations, including Spirit Airlines and A4A, expressed concerns about the accuracy of disclosures on ticket agent websites, and Southwest Airlines supported 75 ACPAC Meeting Minutes (June 28, 2022), p. 13 at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018- 0190-0073. extending disclosure requirements to ticket agents. Allied Tour & Travel, a small ticket agent, expressed concerns about the burden of compliance for small tour operators that include airfare in a travel package. Regarding corporate travel agents, multiple ticket agent associations asked the Department to exclude them from the final rule\u2019s coverage. These commenters generally stated that the Department should exempt corporate travel agents from the final rule\u2019s requirements because ancillary fee disclosures by those agents are the subject of contractual agreement between a business client and the travel agent, with the relevant ancillary services and fees negotiated as part of the contract. The Travel Management Coalition (TMC) testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that its customers are frequent travelers, often use the same routes, and are highly familiar with ancillary fee information. In addition, Travel Tech commented that certain ancillary fees, like family seating fees, are irrelevant for corporate clients, and others, including baggage fees and flight change fees, are not a significant consideration in corporate travelers\u2019 purchasing decisions. TMC agreed that its customers rarely check bags or travel with children. Further, ASTA noted that the corporate client, not the business traveler, generally pays the cost of transportation, including fees. These commenters also cited various precedents for treating business travel differently under consumer protection laws. ASTA and Travel Tech stated that the exclusion for corporate travel agents would be consistent with the European Union\u2019s framework, and TMC testified that Congress recognized the distinction between corporate and public travel in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (2018 FAA Act) by creating an exemption from certain customer service requirements if the sale of an airfare was made pursuant to a corporate contract. Travel Tech, ASTA, and TMC suggested that the Department define \u201ccorporate travel agent\u201d for purposes of a regulatory exclusion as a travel agency \u201cengaged in the provision of travel services primarily to business entities pursuant to a written contract for the business travel of such business entities\u2019 employees.\u201d GBTA instead recommended that the Department exempt what it termed \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cconsortia/agency fares\u201d in the final rule. It asked that DOT consider private fares to be \u201c[d]iscounted or lane (fixed fares between two cities/airports) fares negotiated by travel managers that the airline \u2018files\u2019 with [the Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO)], to be made available to the organization\u2019s agencies of record, as documented in the airline contract, for their travelers to book online or offline.\u201d GBTA further suggested that the Department define \u201cconsortia fares/agency fares\u201d as proprietary fares negotiated by mega agencies and consortia76 offered to customers as an alternative to published fares. In contrast, American Airlines urged the Department not to adopt an exception for corporate travel agents. The airline\u2019s comment stated that it is unreasonable and potentially infeasible to exempt corporate travel agents because few serve exclusively corporate travelers for corporate travel and consumers increasingly book travel that combines business and personal travel. DOT Response: The Department continues to apply the requirements to disclose critical ancillary service fees and policies to ticket agents that sell air transportation; however, the Department is excluding corporate travel agents from these requirements. In excluding corporate travel agents from coverage of this final rule, the Department is agreeing with commenters that there is no need for DOT to apply transparency rules for corporate travel arrangements that are contractually entered into by sophisticated entities. In this rule, the Department is adopting the definition of corporate travel agent as proposed by Travel Tech, ASTA, and TMC, with some modifications. This final rule defines corporate travel agent as a ticket agent that provides travel services to the employees of a business entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business travel of its 76 A travel consortium is a collection of independent travel agencies that combine resources to increase their visibility, revenue, and marketing opportunities. The independent travel agencies that are part of a consortia are known as \u201cmega-agencies\u201d and can offer their customers a consortia rate, which is a preferred negotiated or partnership rate. employees. The \u201cticket agent\u201d need not be a single travel agent to meet the definition in this final rule, but could instead be a consortium of travel agents, as suggested in GBTA\u2019s comment. While some commenters recommended that DOT exclude corporate travel agents if they are primarily engaged in such activity, the Department instead adopts a transaction-specific approach and is applying this rule to ticket agents that are not acting as corporate travel agents in the specific transaction at issue. Under the final rule, if a ticket agent acts entirely as a corporate travel agent with respect to a transaction or a corporate flight booking portal, for example, then the rule\u2019s ancillary fee disclosure requirements would not apply for that transaction or on that booking portal. Because ticket agents may act as a corporate travel agent with respect to certain clients and also have booking systems available to the general public, this rule does not exclude a ticket agent that sells air transportation from the requirement to display fees or policies for critical ancillary services due to that agent\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d activity as a corporate travel agent. This approach ensures information about critical ancillary services are not improperly excluded from leisure travelers who are not covered by a contractual agreement. A transaction-specific approach prevents consumer confusion from the presence of inconsistent information offered on different platforms. This transaction-specific approach also addresses the concerns raised by American Airlines that few travel agents serve exclusively business clients. Those travel agents that provide airfare sales exclusively to business entities under a written contract for the business travel of the business entities\u2019 employees would be fully excluded from the rule\u2019s requirements. Those travel agents engaged in a mix of business and non-business sales would need to provide the ancillary fee disclosures required by this final rule to any traveler selecting flights who is not engaged in business travel covered by a written contract. As for section 427 of 2018 FAA Act, which was cited by TMC in support of its request for an exclusion, it demonstrates that exclusion from consumer protection requirements for sales made pursuant to corporate contracts is not unusual. Section 427 provides protection from enforcement for noncompliance of any customer service standard or requirement in a DOT final rule that requires ticket agents to adopt customer service standards applicable to carriers to the extent \u201cthe sale of air transportation is made . . . pursuant to a specific corporate or government fare management contract.\u201d While the Department is addressing the issue of whether to require ticket agents to adopt minimum customer service standards applicable to carriers in another rulemaking,77 the Department agrees with TMC that section 427 differentiates between corporate and public travel. Regarding Allied Tour & Travel\u2019s comment, the Department has determined that the disclosures required by this rule should apply to ticket agents, regardless of size. Creating different standards based on the ticket agent\u2019s size would add to consumer confusion, as noted earlier, due to the presence of inconsistent information on different platforms. In consideration of the potential for varying degrees of burden, however, this final rule provides those ticket agents that meet the SBA definition of a small entity with additional time to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements beyond the time permitted for other ticket agents, in recognition that it may take additional time for small ticket agents to comply with new disclosures (discussed in section F). (c) Metasearch Sites Proposal: The Department proposed to require entities that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers (i.e., metasearch sites) to display critical ancillary service fees when fare and schedule information is provided. The Department proposal treated metasearch entities as ticket agents. Comments: Multiple metasearch entities, CCIA, and Travel Tech expressed their view that metasearch entities do not meet the statutory definition of \u201cticket agent,\u201d and should not be subject to the rule because they do not sell air transportation. Booking Holdings also noted that many parts of the proposed rule, such as the transactability of family seating fees, were 77 See Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57) at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57. inapplicable to metasearch sites as they do not sell tickets. CCIA also raised  and security concerns about the possibility that such entities would need to handle personal or payment information, which they do not handle today. Google added that it does not currently collect passenger information and expressed concern that it would need to do so under the proposed rule to verify passenger identities. Metasearch entities, as well as CCIA and Travel Tech, also overwhelmingly disagreed with the NPRM\u2019s proposal that metasearch entities be covered under the rule. CCIA, for example, stated in written comments and at public meetings that metasearch entities should be excluded from the rule\u2019s disclosure requirements because they do not have access to fee information and the rule\u2019s disclosure requirements would clutter and negatively impact displays, on which aggregators and metasearch entities compete. Booking Holdings added that a prescriptive approach to metasearch displays will reduce the number of routes offered as part of the initial itinerary search results and have a detrimental effect on competition. It stated that metasearch entities should be afforded flexibility in fee disclosures to ensure they provide innovative and interactive displays for consumers to quickly be able to understand available travel options. From the airline perspective, Southwest Airlines expressed support for applying fee disclosure requirements to metasearch entities, noting that they are an important source of information and that the disclosure rules should apply to them to mitigate consumer confusion on fees. The airline added that section 427 of the 2018 FAA Act directed the Department to apply consistent consumer protection requirements to all large ticket agents to the extent feasible. DOT Response: The Department recognizes the important role metasearch entities play in providing information to consumers and facilitating comparison shopping. As stated previously, the Department is undertaking this rulemaking pursuant to its authority to prohibit carriers and ticket agents from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices. Under 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(45), a ticket agent is \u201ca person (except an air carrier, a foreign air carrier, or an employee of an air carrier or foreign air carrier) that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out as selling, providing, or arranging for, air transportation.\u201d Also as noted by Southwest Airlines in its comment, section 427 of the 2018 FAA Act78 calls for a consistent level of consumer protection regardless of where consumers purchase airfares and related air transportation services. The Act uses section 40102(a)(45)\u2019s existing definition of \u201cticket agent\u201d and clarifies that the term includes \u201ca person who acts as an intermediary involved in the sale of air transportation directly or indirectly to consumers, including by operating an electronic airline information system, if the person\u2014(i) holds the person out as a source of information about, or reservations for, the air transportation industry; and (ii) receives compensation in any way related to the sale of air transportation.\u201d Section 427 directs the Department to use this definition when issuing its final rule requiring ticket agents to adopt customer service standards.79 The Department is deferring to that rulemaking its determination of whether metasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents that must disclose ancillary fee information required. During the pendency of that separate rulemaking, although the Department\u2019s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) has enforced the Department\u2019s aviation consumer protection rules against metasearch entities in the past based on its view that metasearch entities are ticket agents,80 OACP will not enforce the disclosure requirements in this rulemaking against metasearch entities. This enforcement position notwithstanding, the Department encourages airlines and metasearch sites to enter into voluntary agreements to share critical ancillary fee information and for metasearch entities to voluntarily disclose this information to consumers with the fare and schedule information while further regulatory action is under consideration. The Department also notes that the Federal Trade Commission has concurrent jurisdiction over 78 Pub. L. 115-254 (Oct. 5, 2018). 79 See Air Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents (RIN 2015-AE57) at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57. 80 See, e.g., DOT Order 2022-2-6 (FlightHub Group, Inc., et al.) (Feb. 9, 2022). ticket agents and has the authority to both determine whether metasearch entities are ticket agents and take action against ticket agents as well as entities that are not ticket agents irrespective of DOT action. To ensure consumers have access to critical ancillary service fee information upfront, while the Department considers the status of metasearch entities in a separate rulemaking, the Department is requiring that airlines and ticket agents that sell air transportation disclose critical ancillary service fees on the first page of their website or other online platforms to which consumers are directed after searching for flight options on a metasearch site unless the consumer was already provided accurate fee information on the metasearch site. In many cases, airlines and ticket agents that provide fare, schedule, and availability information to metasearch entities permit the metasearch entity to electronically direct consumers to a page on the airline or ticket agent\u2019s website that does not require the consumer to initiate a new itinerary search. Because consumers directed to an airline\u2019s or ticket agent\u2019s website or other online platform from a separate metasearch site may not have an opportunity to view the critical ancillary service fees that apply to them, this rule requires that airlines and ticket agents display the required critical ancillary service fee information on the landing page on the airline or ticket agent\u2019s online platform to which consumers are directed after using a metasearch site. The rule permits an exception in situations where the consumer was provided accurate critical ancillary service fee information on the referring entity\u2019s website. The Department considers it to be an unfair and deceptive practice for a carrier or ticket agent that sells air transportation to fail to make critical ancillary fee disclosures at the first page of its website or other online platform to which a consumer is directed after searching for flights on a metasearch site where that information is not accurately provided. As discussed in section D (1), consumers are substantially harmed if critical ancillary fee information is not provided to them early in the search process, as ancillary fees such as baggage, change, and cancellation fees are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and may make up a significant portion of the total cost of travel. The harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers will likely not be able to determine the fee for critical ancillary services even if a consumer expends time and effort by leaving the booking system to try to determine the fees that apply to the itinerary. Typically, carriers provide change and cancellation fees as a range when viewed outside of the booking process. Consumer advocates have also shared with the Department that consumers have difficulty determining the fee for transporting a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and second checked bag because baggage fee structures are often complex and require charts and calculators to figure out the fees. The lack of fee information is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to competition or consumers. In fact, the lack of information hinders consumers from being able to understand the true cost of their travel and harms competition, rather than benefiting it. The practice is also deceptive because a reasonable consumer would be misled to believing the cost of the travel is lower than what the true cost is if the fees for critical ancillary services are excluded. The disclosure of the fees is material because the fees could affect the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. If metasearch entities are ultimately deemed to be ticket agents subject to this rule, the Department believes that concerns about screen clutter and impacts on innovation have been adequately addressed by the changes the Department has made to the final rule after considering public comments. As noted in this preamble, the final rule provides increased flexibility on method of display of critical ancillary fees, and it does not require the disclosure or transactability of family seating fees. Regarding concerns about  and security of consumer data by metasearch entities, while fee disclosures must be passenger-specific if the consumer affirmatively provides information regarding their status (e.g., frequent flyer status, military status, credit card holder status), such consumer-supplied information is not required to be validated before fees are displayed. Entities covered by this rule are required to disclose passenger-specific fee information based on the status that a consumer purports to have when conducting an itinerary search, regardless of whether the consumer holds such status. The rule does not require entities to collect passenger name, frequent flyer number, or credit card information, and does not implicate the  or security concerns raised by metasearch entities. See discussion on passenger-specific information in section E (5). (2) Covered Operations Proposal: The Department proposed to require fee and policy disclosures of critical ancillary services by airlines and ticket agents on websites marketed to U.S. consumers where air transportation is advertised or sold. On whether a website is \u201cmarketed to U.S. consumers,\u201d the Department noted in the NPRM that the determination would be based on a variety of factors\u2014 for example, whether the website is in English, whether the seller of air transportation displays prices in U.S. dollars, or whether the seller has an option on its website that differentiates sites or pages designed for the United States. In addition to the website disclosures, the Department proposed similar disclosures of critical ancillary services by U.S. and foreign carriers for tickets purchased by telephone or in-person for flights to, within, or from the United States. On fee information distribution, the Department proposed to require that airlines provide fee and policy information about critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display airlines\u2019 fare or schedule information for air transportation to, from, or within the United States. Comments: Air Canada commented that the scope of the rule was broad, and that covering websites marketed to U.S. consumers could result in small ticket agents in foreign jurisdictions leaving the U.S. market because they cannot afford the upfront costs. The airline also expressed concern regarding possible conflicts with foreign consumer protection laws such as those in the European Union. Among ticket agent and metasearch stakeholders, Travel Tech and Skyscanner expressed agreement with the Department that the rule should apply only to those websites designed for use by U.S. consumers. Skyscanner also suggested that the rule\u2019s definition of a \u201cconsumer\u201d should be limited to consumers physically located in the United States when searching for or purchasing tickets. Similar to Air Canada, Skyscanner argued that covering consumers not physically in the United States risks legal conflict with consumer protection regulations in other countries. Booking Holdings said that the proposed disclosures can be required only when a passenger searches for air transportation and added that air transportation as defined by statute does not apply to flights wholly between two foreign points which it interprets as meaning that passengers in the United States who search for flights between two foreign points are not entitled to receive the disclosures set forth in this rule. Skyscanner called for clarification on whether the rule would apply to foreign carriers serving non-U.S. points on flights carrying a U.S. carrier code, expressing the view that foreign carrier flights between non-U.S. points should not be subject to this rule when not carrying a U.S. carrier code, even if the flight can be booked on a website marketed to U.S. consumers. DOT Response: After carefully considering the public comments, the Department has decided to require fee and policy disclosures of critical ancillary services by airlines and ticket agents if they market to consumers in the United States. Under these circumstances, the final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose the fees for critical ancillary services on airlines\u2019 or ticket agents\u2019 websites and other online platforms such as mobile applications (apps). It also requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose critical ancillary fees to consumers during an in- person or telephone discussion about an airline\u2019s fare and schedule if they market to U.S. consumers. The Department has used the phrase \u201cmarketed to U.S. consumers\u201d and similar terminology in other aviation consumer protection and civil rights regulations applicable to websites.81 In one of these rulemakings, the Department explained that the characteristics of a \u201cWeb site that markets air transportation to the general public inside the United States includes, but is not limited to, a site that: (1) contains an option to view content in English, (2) advertises or sells 81 See, e.g., 14 CFR 259.6, 259.7, and 382.43(c), and existing regulation 14 CFR 399.85(d). flights operating to, from, or within the United States, and (3) displays fares in U.S. dollars.\u201d82 The Department further explained \u201cthat non-English (e.g., Spanish) Web sites targeting a U.S. market segment would also be covered; whereas Web sites that block sales to customers with U.S. addresses or telephone numbers, even if in English, would not.\u201d83 Similarly, in this rulemaking, the Department stated that it would consider a variety of factors to determine whether a website is marketed to U.S. consumers, including whether the website is in English, whether the seller of air transportation displays prices in U.S. dollars, or whether the seller has an option on its website that differentiates sites or pages designed for the United States.84 This final rule applies the same factors in determining whether tickets are marketed to U.S. consumers in- person and by phone. This final rule\u2019s applicability to online and offline platforms marketed to U.S. consumers is consistent with the Department\u2019s longstanding position. We have also considered the comments on the scope of air transportation for tickets that include flight segments between two foreign points. Congress authorized the Department to prevent unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation,85 which includes interstate air transportation86 and foreign air transportation.87 The phrase \u201cwhen any part of the transportation is by aircraft\u201d is used in the definition of foreign air transportation, which evidences an understanding that foreign air transportation is not limited to a single flight segment between the United States and a foreign country, but that it can be composed of \u201cparts,\u201d including trips with stopover points and/or flights between two foreign points, provided that the 82 78 FR 67882, 67886 (Nov. 12, 2013). 83 Id. 84 87 FR 63718, 63725 (Oct. 20, 2022). 85 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(5) defines \u201cair transportation\u201d as foreign air transportation, interstate air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft. 86 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(25) defines \u201cinterstate transportation\u201d as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft between a place in a State, territory, or possession of the United States and (i) a place in the District of Columbia or another State, territory, or possession of the United States; (ii) Hawaii and another place in Hawaii through the airspace over a place outside Hawaii; (iii) the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia; or (iv) a territory or possession of the United States and another place in the same territory or possession; and when any part of the transportation is by aircraft. 87 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) defines \u201cforeign air transportation\u201d as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft, between a place in the United States and a place outside of the United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft. passenger\u2019s overall journey is between a place in the United States and a place outside the United States. However, the Department agrees with commenters that flights between two foreign points with no connection to the United States are not foreign air transportation, and the requirements in this rule do not apply to such flights. The Department has determined that \u201cforeign air transportation\u201d includes journeys to or from the United States with brief and incidental stopover(s) at a foreign point without breaking the journey. For purposes of this final rule, we define a break in journey to mean a deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where there is a stopover at a foreign point scheduled. The Department determines whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption depending on various factors such as whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time. For example, a passenger that is traveling on a single ticket that originates or terminates in the United States but also includes travel between two foreign points on a flight marketed with a U.S. carrier code would be considered traveling in foreign air transportation. We believe this approach fully addresses the extraterritoriality concerns raised by some commenters. Regarding comments suggesting that the Department\u2019s requirements apply only to consumers residing in the United States, we disagree. The Department\u2019s authority to prevent unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation is not limited to aviation consumers who are residents of the United States. The Department acknowledges Air Canada and Skyscanner\u2019s concern about the potential for conflict with international requirements. However, there has not been evidence provided that covering consumers not physically in the United States risks legal conflict with consumer protection regulations in other countries as the commenters assert. Further, although the protection of this rule is not limited to consumers who reside in the United States, this rule only applies to airlines and ticket agents if they market to consumers in the United States. In response to Air Canada\u2019s concern that small ticket agents in foreign jurisdictions may leave the U.S. market, the Department is of the view that entities that participate in the U.S. market by marketing to U.S. consumers must comply with the same consumer protection requirements to ensure consumers know the fees charged for critical ancillary services upfront regardless of where consumers purchase air fares and related transportation services. This helps to mitigate the potential for surprise fees that can add up and quickly overcome what may, at first, look like a cheap ticket. (3) Critical Ancillary Services Proposal: The Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents disclose upfront fee and policy information for all ancillary services critical to a consumer\u2019s air transportation purchasing decisions. The Department proposed to treat the following ancillary services as critical: transporting a first checked, second checked, and/or carry-on baggage, changing or canceling a reservation, and obtaining adjacent seating when traveling with a young child (i.e., family seating), but it did not propose a definition of \u201ccritical ancillary service.\u201d The Department solicited comment on whether its proposed list of critical ancillary fees should be expanded or limited, how to address future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees, and how to ensure their disclosure to the extent that they are of critical importance to consumers. General Comments: Several airlines and associations questioned the Department\u2019s basis for selecting those ancillary fees classified as \u201ccritical\u201d in the NPRM and not others. For example, United Airlines stated that the list of ancillary fees that the Department proposed to consider critical was \u201carbitrary and perplexing\u201d and added that it was unclear why DOT had proposed to treat the selected ancillary service fees as critical and not others, such as \u201cadvanced seat assignments, preferential seating, charges for boarding passes, and charges for basic onboard refreshments like water, coffee, and sodas.\u201d Similarly, Air Canada listed \u201cadvanced seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment, in-flight meals, and lounge access\u201d as other fees that could be disclosed and stated that \u201cto meet the goal of allowing consumers to have full cost information . . . all ancillary fees of every kind would have to be included on the first page,\u201d which it acknowledged would be \u201cimpossible.\u201d Finally, IATA asked the Department \u201cto set forth in greater detail [its] determination that these [proposed] optional services are indeed \u2018critical.\u2019\u201d A few airline commenters also stated that the selection of fees would disadvantage ultra- low-cost carriers (ULCCs). For example, United Airlines stated, \u201c[w]hether intentional or not, the Department\u2019s choice of \u2018critical\u2019 ancillary fees seems to arbitrarily favor carriers who bundle those particular services and disfavors other airlines, particularly [ULCCs],\u201d adding that the \u201crulemaking ultimately could cause a global increase in ticket prices by incentivizing all carriers to include those services in the cost of a ticket even though most passengers do not use the services.\u201d Frontier Airlines also expressed a similar view at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing and in its written comments. Frontier Airlines added that, in its view, unbundling is more transparent, economically efficient, and lower cost for consumers, who do not need to pay for ancillary services they will not use. A comment from FlyersRights and a joint comment from multiple groups representing consumers recommended that, instead of requiring separate disclosure of ancillary fees, the Department require ticket sellers to allow consumers to select their desired ancillary services and then provide a single total fare inclusive of the selected ancillary services. The joint comment stated that its proposal would allow consumers to \u201ccompare search results more immediately and accurately,\u201d avoiding clutter and unnecessary calculations by consumers. Consumer groups also suggested that the Department require disclosure of ancillary service fees that may in the future become more prevalent or may be of particular importance to consumers. Comments regarding each of the ancillary services that the Department proposed to consider critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and comments on additional ancillary services are discussed in sections E (3)(a) through E (3)(d). DOT Response: The Department has determined that it is appropriate to provide a definition of \u201ccritical ancillary service\u201d in this final rule. This final rule defines critical ancillary service to mean \u201cany ancillary service that is critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions\u201d and identifies transporting the first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag and changing and cancelling a reservation as critical ancillary services. In addition, the Department addresses the potential for future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees that may be critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions by including in the definition of critical ancillary service \u201cany other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.\u201d Regarding the impact of this rule on ULCCs, the Department does not agree with some commenters\u2019 view that this rule will unfairly disadvantage ULCCs. Rather than placing ULCCs at a competitive disadvantage, the Department expects that this rule will promote competition by making fees for critical ancillary services more transparent for consumers. This will allow consumers to evaluate whether to purchase air transportation on a given carrier, including a ULCC, with the benefit of more complete up-front pricing information. Given the benefits of the \u201cunbundled\u201d ULCC model that Frontier and others touted in their comments, improved transparency should not cause ULCCs to fundamentally alter such a business model (i.e., changing from an unbundled model to a bundled model). Moreover, nothing in this final rule requires them to do so. The Department is not adopting in this final rule the recommendation of some consumer organizations to require airlines and ticket agents to display a total fare that is inclusive of all ancillary fees selected by the consumer. Currently, some airlines apply different baggage fees depending on when and where the ancillary service is purchased (e.g., in advance, at the airport, etc.), which may make display of a single fare, inclusive of baggage fees, impracticable. In addition, requiring a ticket agent to display a total \u201cfare\u201d that includes baggage that cannot be purchased with the ticket on its site could result in consumer confusion about the cost of the fare purchased and what it includes.88 Further, change and cancellation fees, which also may vary based on the circumstances of the change or cancellation for any given ticket, may be less useful incorporated into the fare presented because the consumer is unlikely to know at the time of ticket purchase whether they will change or cancel their ticket, and the applicability of certain fees may be mutually exclusive (e.g., a fee to cancel a ticket 30 days in advance and a fee to cancel a ticket on the day of travel cannot both be imposed). (a) Transporting First Checked Bag, Second Checked Bag, and Carry-on Bag Proposal: The Department proposed to treat fees for a first checked, second checked, and a carry-on bag as critical ancillary fees that airlines and ticket agents must disclose to consumers with fare and schedule information. This proposal was intended to replace the existing requirement for carriers and ticket agents to provide a generic notice during the booking process that baggage fees may apply and where the consumer can find these fees on the carrier\u2019s website. In proposing to treat fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag as critical, the Department noted that consumer commenters to the Department\u2019s 2014 NPRM most commonly identified these baggage fees as critical, and such fees continue to serve as a leading source of consumer complaints regarding ancillary fees to the Department.89 The Department further explained that the cost of baggage fees is often material to consumers and likely to affect their purchasing decisions. In addition, the Department noted that, although the 2011 final rule improved consumer access to baggage fee information by requiring airlines and ticket agents to display the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on bags on their 88 This final rule does not require baggage fees to be transactable by ticket agents for the reasons discussed in section E (7). 89 See Number of Consumer Complaints Received by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Aviation Consumer Protection Regarding Ancillary Fees, 2019-May 31, 2023, available in docket at https://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2022-0109. websites, airlines and ticket agents often disclose those fees in static form in charts that are confusing to consumers and may be provided outside of the booking flow. The Department also noted that consumers continue to report confusion regarding the total cost of baggage fees in connection with complex itineraries, interline tickets, and codeshare flights. Comments: Industry commenters were split on whether the fees for first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag are critical to consumer\u2019s purchasing decisions. Airlines and airline associations generally took the position that such fees were not critical. Some ticket agents agreed with the Department\u2019s preliminary conclusion that fees for first checked bag second checked bag, and carry-on bag are critical; other ticket agents disagreed. Industry commenters who stated that fees for first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag are not critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions asserted that such fees are already available under existing industry practices and regulatory requirements and that consumers are aware of the existence of baggage fees. For example, Air Canada stated that \u201cbaggage fee information is already transparent and fully disclosed on a carrier\u2019s website where passengers have easy access to relevant information,\u201d citing to its own general baggage fee disclosures. Frontier Airlines noted that it discloses ancillary fee information to consumers during the booking process before purchase. Similarly, American Airlines commented that it currently provides itinerary- or passenger-specific baggage fees before purchase, and IATA stated at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that one large international carrier found that 98 percent of the visits to that airline\u2019s websites exposed passengers to the pages with fees on baggage, seat selection, and refund policies, while the remaining two percent of consumers did not go far enough in the booking flow to see these fees. At that hearing, A4A added that many consumers are members of loyalty programs and are already aware of the ancillary structures of their preferred carriers. Further, Air Canada commented that the decrease in checked baggage and increase in carry-on baggage since the addition of checked baggage fees \u2013 documented in a GAO study that the Department cited in the NPRM \u2013 \u201csupports a logical conclusion that consumers are evidently aware of checked-baggage fees.\u201d Air Canada also stated, however, that \u201c[c]alculation of baggage fees is a complex process and the display of this information on the first page where fares are shown cannot be calculated in certain instances until the carriers are chosen, such as on a multi-carrier itinerary.\u201d IATA raised similar concerns about the complexity of calculating these fees. These commenters added that, in their view, the number of complaints related to baggage fee disclosures and the number of passengers who travel without baggage demonstrate that such fees are not critical. For example, Frontier Airlines asserted that the number of baggage fee complaints received by the Department was \u201cde minimis.\u201d Similarly, IATA testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that in 2022, 3.64 percent of airline complaints related to baggage, with a vast majority pertaining to baggage fee refunds, and Booking Holdings reported that approximately 0.1 percent of the U.S. complaints received by Priceline in 2022 related to baggage fees. In addition, A4A testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing that the lack of civil penalties against U.S. airlines demonstrated the absence of a market failure requiring additional regulation. Frontier Airlines further stated in its hearing testimony and in written comments that over 40 percent of Frontier\u2019s passengers do not pay any seating and baggage fees, fewer than 30 percent purchase a first checked bag, fewer than five percent purchase a second checked bag, and fewer than 20 percent purchase a carry-on bag. Further, American Airlines commented that \u201cthe majority of travelers on American Airlines do not check any luggage, and less than a quarter of travelers on American [Airlines] actually have to pay for any checked bags.\u201d A lack of use by consumers of Google\u2019s baggage filter tool was also cited by A4A in its testimony at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing as evidence that baggage fees are not critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Google had commented that only 1.3 percent of the consumers conducting a search on Google Flights use a feature that enables consumers to integrate bag fees into the displayed costs for flights. Google provided this data to support its suggestion that the Department \u201cconsider deferring the disclosure [of ancillary service fees] until after a specific itinerary has been selected.\u201d Google did not assert that transporting baggage is not a critical ancillary service. Further, in a supplemental response, Google presented the results of a 2018 survey it conducted of U.S. consumers which showed that 54% of people decide about baggage for travel prior to ticket purchase. Similarly, other industry commenters who agreed with the Department\u2019s preliminary conclusion that fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions generally stated that baggage was the most common type of ancillary service used by consumers. For example, Travel Tech stated that \u201cbaggage fees are the most important ancillary fees\u201d for most passengers because \u201c[a]lmost all airline passengers travel with some amount of baggage, whether carry-on or checked, and baggage fees often constitute a practical limit on what consumers can carry with them on trips or what they can bring back from a destination.\u201d Though it agreed that baggage fees are important to consumers, Travel Tech testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that, based on a survey it conducted, 90 percent of U.S. adults are aware of the possibility of paying additional fees for optional services beyond the cost of their airline ticket. But Travel Tech acknowledged that the study did not ask whether consumers were aware of the amount of such fees. Also supporting the importance of baggage fees, Skyscanner reported that its internal user research demonstrated that \u201cmany users are much more concerned about baggage allowances and fees than any single other type of ancillary fee,\u201d with 84 percent of surveyed users stating it was important to know whether a ticket price includes checked baggage. Similarly, Google reported that in a survey it conducted of U.S. consumers in 2018, 71 percent planned to check one bag, six percent planned to check more than one bag, and 21 percent did not plan to check any baggage. Groups representing consumers and some individual consumers also supported the Department\u2019s proposal to treat fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag as critical and to require improved disclosures of those fees. For example, at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing, an American Economic Liberties Project (AELP) representative stated that at the nonprofit organizations where he worked including AELP, he heard from many air travelers who were unaware of fees charged by the ULCCs, including fees for carry-on baggage. This representative further testified that while awareness of checked bag fees has risen, carry-on baggage fees continuously confound travelers and that both consumer organizations where he recently worked receive many complaints from consumers about carry- on and checked baggage fees. This representative cited one instance in which a passenger on Spirit Airlines reported that he had to leave his carry-on bag in his car at the airport because he did not have enough money for the carry-on baggage fee and assumed that only checked bags incurred fees. The Department notes that in response, Spirit Airlines commented that AELP did not provide a date for this incident and stated that it did not appear to be consistent with current consumer knowledge about unbundled fares. The AELP representative added that many travelers fly less than once a year and do not understand the intricacies of flying and are confused by ancillary fees. In addition, FlyersRights testified that improved disclosure of the ancillary fees proposed in the NPRM would decrease consumer confusion and allow airlines to compete based on the total cost of a ticket. Similarly, most individual consumers who commented on this aspect of the proposal requested improved baggage fee disclosures for reasons including that, in their view, it is rare for consumers to travel with no bags at all, baggage fees can significantly increase the total cost of air travel, and improved disclosures would enable comparison shopping. For example, one consumer expressed being surprised with fees for checked baggage and stated that requiring disclosure of baggage fees when airlines and ticket agents first provide itinerary search results \u201cwould be immensely helpful in comparing prices via airfare website searches\u201d and cited his experience purchasing a flight on a ticket agent\u2019s website, only to discover after purchase that undisclosed baggage fees made the overall cost of travel higher than on another airline that the consumer had passed over during the search process. Finally, AARP generally supported the Department\u2019s baggage fee disclosure proposal but also asked DOT to prohibit first checked bag fees entirely, and members of the Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) asked DOT to encourage airlines to waive baggage fees for all members of the uniformed service, including the USPHS. DOT Response: The Department has determined that fees for a first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. The Department disagrees with industry commenters\u2019 assertion that the first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag are not critical, and that their disclosure is unnecessary. Consumers have voiced concerns that the fees for these bags can significantly increase the total price of the airfare beyond what was offered at the time of itinerary search. While estimates of the percentage of consumers who travel with a first checked bag, second checked bag, or carry-on bag vary among commenters, most comments support the conclusion that many consumers travel with a first checked, second checked, and/or carry-on bag. Statements by Travel Tech and others that most consumers travel with at least one type of baggage are supported by Google\u2019s comment that its survey reflects that 71 percent of U.S. consumers plan to check a bag on an upcoming trip. Skyscanner\u2019s internal survey and comments from consumer advocates and individual consumers provide further support for the conclusion that these fees are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Given this information, the Department is not persuaded by airlines\u2019 arguments that fees for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag are unimportant to consumers based on the percentage of consumers conducting a search on Google Flights for baggage information and the number of passengers who travel without baggage. In addition, as discussed in section B, GAO has documented that baggage fees have shifted consumers\u2019 purchasing behavior by encouraging consumers to bring only a carry-on bag to avoid checked bag fees. Air Canada cited this GAO study as support for its view that passengers are aware of the existence of baggage fees, and Travel Tech similarly reported that its own survey indicated that 90 percent of consumers were aware that ancillary fees may be charged. However, neither the GAO study nor any of the comments submitted provide evidence that consumers are aware of the amount of the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry- on baggage at various airlines. Indeed, the complexity that Air Canada and IATA observed that carriers face in calculating baggage fees is likely even more burdensome to consumers who try to calculate the fees applicable to their itineraries based often on static information provided by carriers and ticket agents. In addition, some airlines now charge passengers for carry-on baggage. Indeed, on some carriers, the fees for a carry-on bag may be more costly than a first checked bag, which may surprise consumers who are accustomed to carrying on bags without charge.90 These developments further demonstrate the need for carriers and ticket agents to disclose the fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag to consumers so that consumers understand how baggage fees may affect the total cost of their airfare and are able to determine which carrier\u2019s flight option best suits their circumstances. The Department concludes that existing required disclosures do not adequately address the harm to consumers. Carriers and ticket agents are currently not required to provide fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag in a manner that is readily available when consumers are considering a given fare and itinerary. Instead, fees are often provided in static charts that confuse consumers and do not provide adequate information about the fees that apply based on the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific information. The fact that some carriers may voluntarily provide passenger-specific baggage fee information required by this new rule is not a reason for the Department not to require its disclosure by all ticket agents and airlines. The Department rejects airline commenters\u2019 argument that the number of complaints related to baggage fee disclosures and lack of civil penalties for baggage fee violations demonstrate that such fees are not critical. As explained in section B, the number of complaints 90 See Comments of Spirit Airlines at 12; see also Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees Regulatory Impact Analysis RIN 2105-AF10, Table 1, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT- OST-2022-0109-0002. is only one consideration used to determine whether the Department should address an unfair or deceptive practice through regulation. Also, the Department does not view the lack of civil penalties against U.S. carriers under existing regulatory requirements to demonstrate that a regulation is not needed. The lack of civil penalties under existing rules could instead provide further support for the Department\u2019s conclusion that its concerns with existing ancillary fee disclosures are not adequately addressed by existing regulations. The Department is not adopting recommendations by AARP to prohibit fees for a first checked bag and by the Officers Association of the USPHS to encourage airlines to waive fees for its members because those recommendations are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. (b) Changing and Cancelling a Reservation Proposal: In the NPRM, the Department identified fees for changing or canceling a reservation as being critical to consumers when they choose among air transportation options. The Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose change and cancellation fees and policies to consumers during the booking process when fare and schedule information is provided. In proposing to treat these services as critical, the Department shared its view that not disclosing to passengers upfront the significant fees that they would incur should they need to change or cancel the reservation is an unfair and deceptive practice. The Department explained that carriers are currently not required to provide consumers with change or cancellation fee information until after ticket purchase. In addition, the Department noted that although carriers may have separate webpages that list change and cancellation fees, this information is permitted to be provided in a range. The Department added that, even if not provided in a range, change and cancellation fees may not be simple to understand, as fare categories, passenger status, ticket type, and other factors may impact the applicable change and cancellation fees. Further, the Department explained that carriers are currently permitted to display change and cancellation fees outside the booking flow, which disrupts passengers\u2019 searches and costs them time. Finally, the Department reported that change and cancellation fees are among the top three types of ancillary service complaints it receives. Comments: Groups representing consumers generally supported the Department\u2019s proposal to consider change and cancellation fees to be critical to the consumer\u2019s purchasing decision and to require airlines and ticket agents to display such fees to consumers. A joint comment from multiple groups representing consumers noted that improved disclosure of change and cancellation fees \u201cwould benefit consumers, particularly because many travelers may not budget for such fees when booking flights.\u201d This comment further observed that, based on data from the Department\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), air carriers collected nearly $3 billion in revenue from these charges in 2019.91 The commenter asserted that while some airlines had modified their change and cancellation policies due to COVID-19, the changes were limited, with many airlines still applying these fees to the lowest-tier fares. In addition, FlyersRights testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that disclosure of the critical ancillary fees identified in the NPRM would decrease consumer confusion and improve competition in the market. AARP also supported the proposed requirement for carriers and ticket agents to display change and cancellation fees but asked the Department to work to reduce or eliminate change and cancellation fees. In contrast, airlines and their associations generally opposed the Department\u2019s proposal to treat ticket changes and cancellations as critical ancillary services. These commenters asserted that such services are not critical because few passengers change or cancel flights, and complaints regarding change and cancellation fees represent a small percentage of the overall number of complaints submitted to the Department. In addition, airlines and their associations stated that airlines already provide disclosure of change and cancellation fees on their websites, consumers are already aware of the potential costs associated with changing or cancelling a 91 Citing \u201cReservation Cancellation/Change Fees by Airline 2021,\u201d Bureau of Transportation Statistics. May 2, 2022, https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/reservation-cancellationchange-fees-airline-2021. flight, and many carriers have removed these fees since the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these commenters, American Airlines noted that 15 percent of its passengers change or cancel flights, and Frontier testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing that fewer than 10 percent of its passengers paid change or cancellation fees. A4A testified at the same hearing that the cancellation fee complaints to the Department included in the docket do not appear to be related to transparency and represent a small percentage of the overall number of passengers, and so, in its view, the mandatory display of those fees is unnecessary. Ticket agents and their associations offered different views on whether change and cancellation fees are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and should be displayed. Amadeus stated that change and cancellation fees are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions, and Travel Tech supported disclosure of these fees before purchase. However, the U.S. Travel Association stated that the fees identified by the Department \u201care incidental and not \u2018critically important\u2019 to air transportation.\u201d In addition, at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing, Skyscanner expressed concern that disclosing only a fixed change fee without also disclosing the applicable fare difference, which would necessarily be unknown at the time of purchase, would provide incomplete information to consumers and cause confusion. Air Canada made a similar argument in its written comments. Three of the four ACPAC members expressed the view that ticket change and cancellation fees were critical to consumers. The ACPAC Chair, who is also the member representing state governments, stated that the ability to change and cancel a ticket was more important to consumers now due to an increase in flight cancellations and the potential for an increase in infectious disease numbers. The ACPAC had several recommendations related to ticket change and cancellation, which are discussed in later sections. DOT Response: The Department has determined that the fees imposed on a consumer to change or cancel a ticket (i.e., passenger-initiated changes or cancellations)92 are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision, and this final rule maintains the proposed requirement that airlines and ticket agents must disclose these fees to consumers. The Department is not persuaded by industry commenters who stated that change and cancellation fees are not critical, and disclosure is unnecessary. The Department agrees with the commenters who stated that change and cancellation fees can pose a significant, unexpected financial burden to consumers and that improved transparency will reduce consumer confusion and promote competition. As noted in section B, the number of complaints is only one consideration used to determine whether the Department should address an unfair or deceptive practice through regulation. Nor do the calculations by some airlines that 10-15 percent of their passengers change or cancel flights suggest that change and cancellation fees are not critical given the significant financial cost that change and cancellation fees impose to those passengers who are subject to them. In addition, existing disclosure requirements do not address this issue. As the Department noted in the NPRM, existing regulations do not require airlines or ticket agents to disclose specific change and cancellation fees during the booking process before ticket purchase. There are no existing rules for ticket agents to provide change and cancellation fees, and the existing rules allow airlines to provide change and cancellation fees in ranges rather than specific amounts, making it difficult for consumers to determine the fee that would apply to their ticket. The Department is not persuaded that it should defer regulation in this area because some carriers have eliminated change and cancellation fees. These carriers could re-impose such fees in the future. Further, some carriers that have eliminated change and cancellation fees have not done so for all their flights. For example, these carriers may charge change or cancellation fees for international flights that do not originate from designated locations. Also, many passengers 92 When referring to change or cancellation fees or policies, this rule is referring to consumer- or passenger-initiated changes or cancellations of tickets. This rule does not address changes or cancellations initiated by carriers. who purchase tickets in the lowest fare categories continue to be subject to either change and cancellation fees or outright prohibitions on changing or cancelling their reservations. The Department agrees with those commenters who noted that providing change fee information without information about the requirement to pay a fare difference may create consumer confusion. Because the amount of any fare difference cannot be calculated until a replacement flight is selected, the amount of the fare difference will necessarily be unknown at the time of initial ticket purchase. To reduce any potential for consumer confusion, this final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose in the summary of its change policies that a fare difference may apply, if that is the case, and to make other related disclosures before ticket purchase. These requirements are discussed further in section E (4)(b). (c) Obtaining Adjacent Seats for Families Traveling with Young Children Proposal: The Department proposed that a fee for a child 13 or younger to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult in the same class of service is a critical ancillary fee that airlines and ticket agents must disclose to consumers with the fare and schedule information. Under the proposal, if the carrier does not impose a fee for children 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult, no seat fee disclosure would be required for the carrier\u2019s flights. If the carrier does impose a fee to make an advance seat assignment for a child 13 or under, the NPRM noted that the carrier could comply with the proposed rule by enabling consumers to indicate whether they were traveling with a child prior to initiating a search, or by displaying seat fees for all itinerary searches, regardless of whether a consumer indicated that he or she would be traveling with a child. Comments: The overwhelming majority of commenters opposed the Department\u2019s family seating fee disclosure proposal in the NPRM. Hundreds of individuals and multiple consumer advocacy organizations, including the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, opposed the proposal on the basis that the Department should prohibit family seating fees for air travel instead of requiring fee disclosure. Individual commenters expressed concern with the safety of minors and the comfort of families and other passengers when children 13 or younger are seated away from an accompanying adult on an aircraft. Consumer advocates raised similar concerns. For example, AELP testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that there are serious health and safety issues with seating young children alone and stated that the Department should not be guided by the quantity of complaints it receives on family seating. The few consumer advocates that supported the Department\u2019s proposal similarly recommended that the Department ultimately limit or prohibit family seating fees, with AARP noting that it viewed the proposed disclosures as \u201can essential first step\u201d but also asking the Department to take further action to reduce or eliminate such fees in the future. A joint comment from multiple State attorneys general supported improved seat disclosures but asked DOT to modify its proposal to require that initial search results provide the lowest fee, if any, to book two adjacent seats, along with an additional disclosure if adjacent seats are unavailable. Many industry commenters raised concerns about the expense and technical challenges of providing dynamic seat fees at the first page of search results and the cost of establishing direct, real-time connections between ticket agents and airlines necessary to facilitate such disclosures. IATA stated that the Department\u2019s family seating proposal would impose a greater burden on airlines than the proposals to require disclosure of baggage, change, and cancellation fees \u201cbecause the search [for adjacent seating] is twofold: the fees for each seat on each flight presented in an itinerary as well as a search to determine whether there are two or more seats together at the time of the initial search.\u201d ATPCO explained that \u201ca channel would need at or near real-time seat maps and seat pricing for every possible airline\u2019s flight for every itinerary evaluated at the time of the shopping request\u201d to provide seat fees at first search. Skyscanner explained that determining a family seating fee would require a complex search of highly dynamic seat fees of varying costs and a query of availability, suggesting that, as an alternative, the Department should require disclosure of the cost of a standard seat and not at the time of first search. Among other commenters, Air Canada and IATA stated that GDSs are currently unable to support the distribution of dynamic seat fee information. Industry commenters also expressed concerns that providing family seating fees at the time of first search would overwhelm consumers and provide information that would be irrelevant to many passengers who are not traveling with children. Several industry commenters also stated that consumers rarely consider seats relevant at the beginning of their itinerary search, with Google citing a user survey it had conducted in support of that position. Airlines and their representatives generally opposed all aspects of the Department\u2019s family seating proposal. Airlines stated that current airline policies generally already provide for family seating without fees; the display of a \u201cfamily seating fee\u201d may confuse passengers about the need to purchase a seat to guarantee seating next to a young child; and what these commenters characterized as the low number of family seating complaints and low number of passengers traveling with young children demonstrated no problem with existing disclosures. American Airlines asserted that it could not disclose family seating fees because \u201cthey do not exist\u201d separate from advance seating fees for all other passengers and noted its efforts to seat young children with an accompanying adult. Amadeus, Travelport, and Travel Tech asked that DOT expand its family seating proposal to require airlines to either share all seat fees or the fees for the cost of an adjacent seat generally, without regard to whether the passenger is traveling with a child 13 years old or younger. None of those commenters, however, supported displaying seat fees on the first page of search results. At its January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC recommended that the Department\u2019s proposal regarding the disclosure of family seat fee information should be retained in any final rule that may be adopted. DOT Response: DOT has decided not to move forward with its proposal to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose applicable fees for passengers 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult on an aircraft. Instead, the Department is pursuing a separate rulemaking to address the ability of a young child to sit adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional cost beyond the fare.93 In addition to pursuing a new rulemaking, the Department has taken other steps to encourage airlines to ensure that children 13 or younger are seated adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional cost subject to limited . On July 8, 2022, the Department\u2019s OACP issued a notice urging airlines to do everything they can to allow young children to be seated next to an accompanying adult with no additional charge.94 On March 6, 2023, the Department launched its Airline Family Seating Dashboard, that highlights whether airlines guarantee fee-free family seating,95 and on March 10, 2023, the Department sent a proposal to Congress recommending legislation to require fee-free family seating subject to limited exceptions.96 Given these actions by the Department to enable parents to sit next to their young children without paying fees, the Department does not see value to requiring airlines and ticket agents to display dynamic family seating fees in this final rule. In addition, the Department does not expand disclosure requirements to seat fees or adjacent seat fees more generally, as requested by some commenters, for the reasons discussed in section E (3)(d). (d) Consideration of Additional Ancillary Services (i) Seat Selection Proposal: The Department explained in the NPRM its tentative view that \u201cdisclosure of an advance seat assignment fee at the beginning of a booking process is generally not needed because airlines are required to provide a seat with the cost of the air transportation.\u201d97 93 See Fall 2023 Unified Agenda for rulemaking titled \u201cFamily Seating in Air Transportation\u201d (RIN 2105-AF15) at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AF15. 94 See https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/family-seating/June-2022-notice. That notice was issued in response to section 2309 of the FAA Extension, Safety and Security Act of 2016, which required DOT to review U.S. airline family seating policies and, if appropriate, establish a policy directing air carriers to establish policies enabling a child 13 or under to be seated next to an accompany family member, subject to certain limitations. 95 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-family-seating-dashboard. 96 See https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-03/Bill_Family%20Seating%20Proposal_final.pdf. 97 87 FR 63726. Comments: Comments from some ticket agents and groups representing consumers, along with a few individual consumers, requested that the Department consider all seating fees to be critical, not only the fees for family seating as proposed. Some of those commenters identified additional groups of passengers for whom adjacent seat assignments are, in their view, critical. For example, Amadeus stated that adjacent seating fees may be critical for caregivers or family members of individuals with disabilities or the elderly. Travel Tech similarly identified individuals traveling with the elderly as well as \u201ca newly-wed couple on a 17-hour honeymoon flight or business partners who need to sit together to work during the flight.\u201d The U.S. PIRG Education Fund expressed its support for \u201cup-front disclosure of adjacent seating fees involving adult relatives, friends or colleagues.\u201d In addition, some of these commenters identified reasons that consumers may wish to select their seats when traveling alone. Among those commenters, Travel Tech stated that this may include \u201cpassengers who need to sit near the front of the plane to make a connecting flight or passengers who need to be near the restroom for health reasons.\u201d FlyersRights commented that consumers may want to select seats to have more legroom or to sit near the front of the plane or an emergency exit. GBTA stated that seat selection could be considered critical for business travelers. On the other hand, AARP agreed with the Department\u2019s preliminary assessment in the NPRM that disclosure of general seat selection fees at the beginning of the booking process was not critical. Instead of requiring disclosure of seating fees, AARP requested that DOT require a clear disclosure \u201cwherever advance seat selections are made available, that consumers do not need to pay an additional fee unless they want to reserve a particular seat.\u201d AARP recommended this addition to reduce consumer confusion, explaining that \u201ccustomers are often provided with a limited range of seats to choose from, many or all of which require a fee to reserve\u201d and \u201cmay believe that there are no \u2018free\u2019 seats available and may purchase an advance seat reservation out of concern that they will not be provided with a seat.\u201d As discussed above, airlines and other industry commenters raised concerns about the costs and technological challenges of displaying dynamic seat fees in the context of the Department\u2019s family seating proposal. These concerns would be equally applicable to required disclosure of adjacent seating fees or individual seating fess more generally. In addition, consistent with its comments on family seating fees, American Airlines specifically asked the Department not to expand its list of covered critical ancillary fees to include seating fees more generally. DOT Response: The Department has considered the comments stating that seating fees are critical to consumers purchasing decisions. Given that the cost of air transportation includes a seat and the lack of clarity about the importance of seat selection fees to consumers, the Department is not requiring carriers or ticket agents to disclose seating fees as required critical ancillary service fees in this final rule. In making this determination, the Department also took into account the concerns raised by industry commenters about the challenges of displaying dynamic seating fees discussed in section E (3)(c). The Department intends to monitor this issue for possible future action if warranted. Regarding passengers with disabilities, the Department notes that carriers are already required to provide seating accommodations that meet passengers\u2019 disability-related needs under the Air Carrier Access Act and its implementing regulation, 14 CFR part 382. These required accommodations include an adjoining seat for a personal care attendant who performs a function for a passenger with a disability that is not required to be performed by airline personnel, a reader for a passenger who is blind or has low vision, an interpreter for a passenger who is deaf or hard-of-hearing, or a safety assistant, if needed. Finally, the Department agrees with AARP that the option to purchase seats could confuse consumers, who may think that a seat purchase is necessary. The Department has determined that it is a deceptive practice in violation of section 41712 for a carrier or ticket agent to fail to disclose that the purchase of a seat is not required for travel, particularly when consumers are provided seats from which to choose where many, if not all, of those seats require a fee to reserve. Without a clear disclosure, a reasonable consumer being offered seats to reserve where many of these seats must be purchased would be misled to believe that an advance seat assignment purchase is required to have a confirmed seat on the flight. The lack of disclosure that consumers will be assigned a seat without additional payment is material as this omission is likely to result in consumers unnecessarily paying a fee for a seat. Accordingly, this final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to make the following disclosure clearly and conspicuously when a consumer is offered a seat selection for a fee: \u201cA seat is included in your fare. You are not required to purchase a seat assignment to travel. If you decide to purchase a ticket and do not select a seat prior to purchase, a seat will be provided to you without additional charge when you travel.\u201d (ii) Other Ancillary Services Proposal: The Department did not propose ancillary services, beyond transporting a first checked, second checked, and/or carry-on bag, changing or canceling a reservation, and obtaining adjacent seating when traveling with a young child, to be critical. However, the Department sought comment on whether the ancillary services proposed to be critical in the NPRM should be expanded or limited. Comments: Airline commenters generally opposed expanding the ancillary services to be considered critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. The Department received only limited support for adding other specific ancillary fees to the list of ancillary services proposed to be covered as critical in the NPRM. A few individual commenters asked the Department to include fees for food and a drink as well as in-flight wi-fi as critical ancillary service fees. In addition, GBTA stated that wi-fi and priority boarding could be considered critical for business travelers. Finally, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association asked that the rule be expanded to cover all general aviation parking fees and the location of parking aprons at airports. Comments suggesting the Department limit the ancillary services proposed to be critical are discussed in section E (3)(d)(iii). DOT Response: The Department declines to expand in this final rule the list of specific critical ancillary fees beyond those identified in its proposal as the record does not support considering fees for food, drinks, wi-fi, priority boarding, or parking fees as critical ancillary service fees as suggested by a few commenters. As discussed in the next section, the Department may determine that additional ancillary fees are critical after notice and an opportunity for comment. The Department maintains the existing requirement that airlines must disclose the fees for all ancillary services on their websites. Carriers and ticket agents are encouraged to provide consumers with a clear and conspicuous link to this existing website during the booking process before ticket purchase. Airlines will continue to be allowed to provide the fees for ancillary services, aside from baggage, in a range on this page. Consumers will be provided the specific fees that apply to them for all critical ancillary services when the fare and schedule information is provided following an itinerary search. (iii) Future Ancillary Services Proposal: The Department solicited comment on whether its proposed list of critical ancillary fees should, among other things, address future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees. The Department also asked how to ensure their disclosure to the extent that they are of critical importance to consumers. Comments: Multiple consumer groups asked the Department to require airlines and ticket agents to display additional ancillary service fees in the future to the extent that the fees become more prevalent or are of particular importance to consumers. FlyersRights suggested the Department require carriers and ticket agents to display any fee that comprises two percent of all reporting carriers\u2019 revenue or five percent of any single airline\u2019s revenue, stating that its proposal was intended to address its concern that \u201cairlines may innovate new ways to break up the base fare into additional ancillary fees.\u201d Similarly, a joint comment from multiple groups representing consumers asked the Department to require disclosure of fees that exceed two percent of a covered entity\u2019s revenue according to BTS reporting and to adopt a regular review schedule to periodically update the covered ancillary fees with feedback from consumer advocates. In addition, multiple State attorneys general requested that the Department adopt an open-ended provision requiring disclosure of \u201cfees associated with any products or services that a reasonable traveler might foreseeably consider necessary.\u201d On the other hand, American Airlines opposed any expansion of the list of critical ancillary fees from the NPRM. It stated that expanding the list would \u201cfurther complicate the search queries, slowing the return of search results and cluttering displays\u201d and provide minimal, if any, benefit to consumers. American Airlines asked the Department to rely on enforcement actions, rather than regulation, to address any innovations in ancillary fees that result in significant consumer complaints. DOT Response: Based on the comments received, the Department has not identified any fees beyond fees for transporting a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag and fees for changing and cancelling a ticket that are currently critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The Department agrees with those commenters who stated that the Department should have a method for regulating fee transparency for any ancillary services critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions in the future. The Department disagrees, however, with those commenters who suggested that the Department should establish a fixed interval to reevaluate the fees for critical ancillary services. The Department receives regular feedback from stakeholders, including through the ACPAC, and monitors trends in consumer complaints filed with the Department. If these or other sources suggest that disclosure of additional ancillary services fees early in the purchasing process is needed based on evolving industry practices, the Department can provide notice and take comment at that time. The regularity with which the Department hears from stakeholder groups renders it unnecessary to establish a fixed time interval for re- evaluating ancillary fees. The Department is also not persuaded by comments urging the Department to require disclosure of ancillary fees that reach a certain threshold of airline revenue because carriers could design their fee structures in a manner to avoid any pre-established threshold. In this final rule, the Department is not limiting ancillary services that are critical to those that meet a certain threshold but instead adopting a definition of critical ancillary service that includes \u201cany other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.\u201d Multiple State attorneys general also recommended establishing an open-ended provision when defining critical ancillary fee. This final rule differs from their recommendation in that it provides the public an opportunity for comment before the Department delineates additional critical ancillary fees. The Department believes that effective and meaningful public engagement before determining additional ancillary services that are critical will lead to a better result. (4) Methods for Disclosing Critical Ancillary Service Fees and Policies (a) Website Disclosure of Fees Proposal: The Department proposed to require that the fees for ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision be disclosed the first time that an airfare is displayed to consumers using airlines\u2019 or ticket agents\u2019 websites. More specifically, the Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents disclose the first and second checked bag fees, the carry-on bag fee, the change and cancellation fees and the family seating fee at the first point in a search process where a fare and schedule is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. The Department further proposed to prohibit display of fees for critical ancillary services by links and rollovers but requested comment on whether to allow these methods. The Department further proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to indicate that a particular fare category prohibits the checking of a bag or the carriage of a carry-on bag, if that is the case, and any applicable penalty to transport the item, whenever fare and schedule information is provided during the itinerary search process. The Department also proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed, which could be provided via a pop-up or link adjacent to the pertinent change or cancellation fee. Comments: Industry commenters expressed near-universal opposition to the requirement to display fees for critical ancillary services without the use of links or rollovers when an airline or ticket agent first provides schedule and fare information in response to an itinerary search. These commenters expressed concerns about the costs, technological feasibility, and impacts on website clarity and function if airlines and ticket agents are required to display all proposed critical ancillary fees (first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag, ticket changes and cancellations, and family seating) without the use of links or rollovers when airlines and ticket agents first provide schedule and fare information. Many industry commenters stated that display of all critical ancillary fee information required under the proposal on a single page without the use links or rollovers would result in airlines and ticket agents displaying fewer itinerary results and would overcrowd webpages. For example, Frontier Airlines stated that under existing regulations, it could display four or five itinerary options on the first page of search results, but estimated that under the proposal, it would only be able to display one or two results per page. Frontier Airlines further expressed concern that crowded displays would block out or minimize information that it views as more relevant to consumers, including additional flight options and base fares. Similarly, United Airlines estimated that it would be able to display only half of the number of flight options to consumers under the proposal compared with its current website. Booking Holdings stated that a first-page display requirement for all ancillary fees proposed could reduce the number of itinerary results it could display on a single page from 12 under existing regulations to only one or two. Booking Holdings expressed concern that the NPRM\u2019s proposal to require carriers or ticket agents to display all critical ancillary fees when fare and schedule information is first provided would result in consumers spending additional time scrolling or \u201cgiving up\u201d on their search and selecting a less optimal flight than they would under existing disclosures. Finally, the U.S. Travel Association stated that, under the proposal, customers would need to scroll through multiple pages of results, increasing the time needed to consider available ticket options. Many industry commenters, including Frontier Airlines, Google, Booking Holdings, and others explained or provided visual displays of how search results would appear on their websites under the proposal in written comments or at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing. For example, Google provided an example where both vertical and horizontal scrolling was needed to show all ancillary fee information proposed at the first page of search results. Amadeus also testified at the hearing that providing all critical ancillary fees required by the proposal at the first point in the search process where schedule and fare information is provided would reduce the number of flight options that could be displayed and, correspondingly, reduce the inter-brand competition that the indirect channel provides. In addition, industry commenters raised concerns that, in their view, displaying all required ancillary fees at the first page of search results would slow website  times significantly and degrade the consumer experience, resulting in consumers abandoning carrier and ticket agent websites. For example, American Airlines estimated that its current search takes three to five seconds to process and load but believes displaying all proposed critical ancillary fees on the first page would take 45 seconds to process and load. In addition, Spirit Airlines stated that providing all proposed ancillary fees would take seven times as long to load as its current site and could require nine minutes of transaction time. Further, United Airlines expressed concern about the effect that slower  times would have on sales, stating that half of consumers abandon websites that take more than six seconds to load and over 50 percent expect a website to load in three seconds or less. At the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing, IATA cited studies stating that for every second of  performance, there is an equivalent drop in customer presence and sales. Booking Holdings stated that \u201cthe calls for data under the proposal could potentially be in the hundreds of thousands (especially for itinerary results that include multiple carriers or multiple passengers),\u201d and, while its current system runs similar queries, it does so only \u201cafter a passenger selects a flight option, thus reducing the search queries to that one flight itinerary, instead of thousands of potential flight itineraries.\u201d In addition, Travel Tech commented that every second added to website load times results in a seven percent loss in sales and 11 percent fewer page views. Further, industry commenters stated that the proposed rule would require airlines and ticket agents to provide ancillary fee information at a time that is not optimal for consumer decision making and that the timing and method for displaying ancillary fees is best left to industry expertise. Among those commenters, Spirit Airlines commented that it conducted a survey of consumers who abandoned booking and found that less than one percent abandoned the booking path because bag prices were not displayed at the beginning of search, which it stated demonstrates that \u201c[a]lmost all customers who decide not to fly Spirit are unbothered by ancillary fees being provided later in the booking path.\u201d Further, Spirit Airlines stated that it showed a sample web display complying with the NPRM to \u201cindependent testers,\u201d who preferred Spirit\u2019s current site and stated that they preferred to select the flight first and then select from baggage and seating options. Air Canada stated that its current practice of providing consumers with a full price breakdown of all charges on a summary page before booking is \u201cmore informative and useful for consumers\u201d than the Department\u2019s proposal because it lists all charges, not only those ancillary fees that the Department deems critical. In addition, Booking Holdings represented that its customers prefer concise information at the first page of search results and that ancillary fee information is more helpful after consumers select a specific itinerary. A4A testified that display of ancillary fees at the time of first search could confuse consumers that such fees are mandatory and cause consumers to abandon their travel due to the perceived expense or to purchase ancillary services that are unnecessary for their travel. Further, NACA stated that providing ancillary fee information at the time fare and schedule information is first provided would overwhelm ULCC consumers, adding that selecting one ancillary at a time makes the booking process easier and that the unbundled model \u201cinherently requires enhanced disclosure and education, which the ULCCs already provide.\u201d NACA also noted that E.O. 14036 instructed the Department to consider initiating a rulemaking to ensure disclosure of ancillary fee information, including change and cancellation fees, \u201cat the time of ticket purchase,\u201d but it did not require the Department to initiate a rulemaking or to require disclosure at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. Google provided some statistical data related to its position that baggage fees are more relevant to consumers later in the booking process. Google reported that 1.3 percent of consumers conducting a search on Google Flights use a feature allowing them to integrate bag fees into the displayed costs for flights before a specific itinerary has been selected. At the Department\u2019s public hearing in March 2023, Google testified that this statistic supported its position that baggage information may be relevant to consumers later in the search process, rather than at the point of initial search. Google also provided the results of a study of U.S. consumers it conducted in 2018. It cited this study as evidence that consumers prefer to think about baggage fees later in the booking process, with 21 percent of consumers in the survey stating that they start thinking about baggage while searching for flights but 23 percent of consumers in the survey stating that do not start thinking about baggage until the time of flight booking. In addition, according to the results reported by Google, 19 percent of consumers \u201cdecide about baggage\u201d at the time of flight search, but another 35 percent do not decide about baggage until the time of flight booking. A4A provided testimony on the costs of the proposal at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing, stating that the proposal to require display of all critical ancillary fees on the first page of search results would require an overhaul of the entire air fare \u201cecosystem.\u201d A4A further testified that the costs would be exorbitant and exceed the technical capacity of airline systems, which it added are not currently built to retrieve and display the amount of fee information required. Many other industry commenters provided similar testimony or written comments. Additional discussion of the economic impacts of the final rule is provided in the Regulatory Notices section of this document. Some industry commenters also raised specific concerns with the technical ability to calculate and display fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag at the first page where airlines or ticket agents provide fare and schedule information in response to a search without the use of rollovers or links. IATA stated that this proposed requirement is \u201cunreasonable\u201d and added that the calculation of baggage fees is \u201cnot trivial, particularly with multi-carrier itineraries, and neither airlines nor agents today are capable of undertaking the calculation on what could be more than 100 itineraries presented on an initial search page.\u201d IATA added that, in its view, the costs of the requirement would outweigh any benefits. Similarly, Air Canada stated that the calculation of baggage fees \u201cis a complex process,\u201d particularly for multi-carrier itineraries, and that the development of \u201cancillary service packages or subscriptions that allow passengers to, among other services, have unlimited checked baggage after paying an annual fee or the bundling of baggage fees with those of meals or Wi-Fi\u201d would make displaying baggage fees on the first page of search results more challenging. A few industry commenters recommended that, if the Department decides to require airlines and ticket agents to display any ancillary fees when fare and schedule information is first provided, it should do so only for the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage. For example, Travel Tech stated that if the Department chose to adopt \u201cany prescriptive rules,\u201d those requirements \u201cshould be limited to requiring that only critical baggage fees . . . be displayed on the first search results page.\u201d Travel Tech added that \u201c[b]y so limiting the amount of information required to be displayed on the first search results page, DOT can largely avoid the information overload and page clutter problems\u201d identified in its comments. Skyscanner made similar comments, stating that it recommended \u201cthat no display requirement mandating a specific location for the display of ancillary fee information should be imposed,\u201d but continuing that \u201cif such a rule is imposed, it should require that only baggage fees be displayed on the first page of ticket search results.\u201d Skyscanner added that its recommendation was based on its internal user research indicating \u201cthat many users are much more concerned about baggage allowances and fees than any single other type of ancillary fee,\u201d with 84 percent indicating \u201cit was important to know whether a ticket price includes checked bags.\u201d Industry commenters, including IATA, also stated that the complexity of calculating multiple change and cancellation fees for multiple itineraries would be technologically infeasible (particularly for multi-carrier itineraries), result in significantly slow website , and be extremely costly to implement. For example, IATA commented that the cost of calculating multiple change and cancellation fees \u201cfor every itinerary at the initial search cannot be justified in  of search time saved by passengers.\u201d Instead of first page display of fees for critical ancillary services in text form, industry commenters generally requested more flexible display of these fees. Alternatives recommended by these commenters included the Department allowing the display of fee information later in the booking process; the use of links, pop-ups, rollovers, and other methods; and the display of fee information outside of the booking process. For example, individual airlines also recommended that the Department allow links and rollovers. United Airlines suggested that the Department permit disclosures through links, pop-ups, banners, landing pages, and acknowledgements. American Airlines explained that links and rollovers \u201cwould allow consumers to access the fee information as needed on an individual basis and avoid overwhelming consumers by flooding them with information at the first shopping point.\u201d Similarly, ticket agent representatives such as Travel Tech recommended allowing critical ancillary fee information to be displayed using pop-ups and links. Booking Holdings recommended that the Department allow airlines and ticket agents to display fees by hovering over or clicking a link or allowing disclosures on the second page of the booking process after a flight is selected. Further, Google stated that more flexibility in display would better serve consumers, and expounded that rollovers, hyperlinks, and pop-ups would give disclosures to consumers in a readable and customizable format. Hopper and other commenters advocated for display at any time before ticket purchase. At the Department\u2019s March 2023 public hearing, Amadeus advocated for allowing more flexible displays such as hyperlinks, mouseovers, pop- ups, expandable text, and other shortcuts to facilitate faster and cost-efficient implementation across the industry. According to Amadeus, those methods help avoid performance issues and reduce the number of transactions, extending computing resources and improving the time necessary to provide search results. In addition, Air Canada asked the Department to clarify when \u201cfare and schedule information is first provided\u201d if it chose to finalize the proposal. The carrier also asked the Department to allow carriers to display required ancillary fee disclosures \u201cexternal to the booking process.\u201d Specific to change and cancellation fee disclosures, Amadeus asked the Department to allow display of minimum and maximum change and cancellation fees, rather than all potentially applicable change and cancellation fees. IATA suggested that carriers could include a link on the initial search page to clear language on whether the carrier imposes change or cancellation fees and what factors are considered in setting that fee. Skyscanner recommended that DOT require display of one change fee and not on the first page of search results. In their comments and public hearing testimony, multiple groups representing consumers expressed support for the Department\u2019s proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to display critical ancillary service fees when fare and schedule information are first displayed in response to a consumer search. FlyersRights commented that the proposal would achieve better price transparency for consumers. In addition, at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing, FlyersRights testified that current market  reward those airlines that hide the ball at the expense of more transparent airlines and asserted that one airline\u2019s website requires many clicks from the first page where schedule and fare information is displayed before a consumer reaches the web page where static baggage fees are disclosed. Further, a joint comment from multiple groups representing consumers supported the Department\u2019s proposal to prohibit the use of links and rollovers to display fees for critical ancillary services. The U.S. PIRG Education Fund added that in its view, fee information should be provided before beginning the booking process, not once it has begun, and expressed concerns about drip pricing. Finally, the ACPAC Chair, representing state and local governments, stated at the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting that the Department\u2019s proposal was \u201cfair\u201d in permitting airlines and ticket agents to display baggage policies, but not baggage fees, in links and pop-ups based on her belief that the average flyer better understands what constitutes an oversized bag than the actual bag fee amounts. A few organizations representing consumers, however, expressed concern about the potential for consumer confusion under this aspect of the Department\u2019s proposal. AARP was generally supportive of the Department\u2019s proposal, noting that not providing critical ancillary fee information when a fare is provided would inhibit the ability of consumers \u201cto make an informed decision about which price and itinerary combination best suits their need,\u201d and adding that if fees are disclosed at the end of the booking process \u201cthat consumer is much less likely to re-start the process of comparison shopping, leading to a less than optimal outcome.\u201d But AARP further recommended that any \u201cdisclosures must be made in such a way as to minimize visual clutter and confusion and be easy to read and comprehend.\u201d In addition, Travelers United testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that more disclosure was preferrable but also expressed concern in its written comment that \u201cDOT is seriously underestimating the technology needed for this NPRM as it stands now. Perhaps limiting it to only baggage may provide enough information to deal with today\u2019s competition and prepare for the coming age of AI [artificial intelligence].\u201d Individuals also expressed differing views. For example, one individual stated that how and when airlines display the elements of a total fare should be left to airlines and suggested that consumers could purchase from a different airline should a particular airline provide a confusing display. However, another took the position that baggage fees are the most important charges to consumers and displays with this information would not confuse consumers or be excessive. This commenter noted that airlines already provide first and business class fares that many consumers will never use. The ACPAC solicited information on the appropriate timing of disclosure for critical ancillary service fees at its December 2022 meeting. At that meeting, the ACPAC member representing consumers observed that to minimize problems with drip pricing, consumers should have information on critical ancillary service fees early in the process. However, he also noted that providing early information on all ancillary fees could lead to consumers being overwhelmed. Specifically, he opined that baggage fees, change/cancellation fees, and seat reservation fees were the biggest \u201cpain points\u201d for consumers that should be disclosed early. Similarly, a consumer advocacy organization suggested that fees for carry-on and checked bags, as well as change/cancellation fees and on-time/cancellation statistics, should be displayed on the first page where a price is quoted.98 At its January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC recommended that the Department adopt its proposal to require change and cancellation fee information be displayed during the itinerary search process and not just before ticket purchase. The ACPAC member representing consumers noted that change and cancellation fees impact consumers\u2019 buying decisions when shopping for an airline ticket, and that if the disclosures are not made early in the purchase process, consumers would not have change and cancellation fee information on all the options available to them when making a purchasing decision. The ACPAC member representing airlines expressed his concern that disclosure of the baggage and change and cancellation fees during the itinerary search process would present too much information to consumers and advocated for links or pop- ups to be permitted for the display of baggage and change and cancellation fee information if there is a requirement to display such fee information. The ACPAC also recommended at its January 12, 2023, meeting that the Department require ticket agents and metasearch entities to display airlines\u2019 change and cancellation fee information in a consistent manner to avoid creating confusion for consumers. The ACPAC 98 Presentation of FlyersRights, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0046. member representing airports explained that a ticket agent should not be allowed to display an itinerary for one airline that shows the total change or cancellation fees for a group of travelers, while the itinerary for another airline shows the change or cancellation fees on a per passenger basis. Travel Tech commented that the ACPAC recommendation goes beyond the proposals of the NPRM and fails to recognize that ticket agents do not receive data from airlines consistently and lack the resources to implement this recommendation. Regarding the Department\u2019s proposal that consumers be informed when fare and schedule information is provided if the fare category does not permit traveling with a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag or permit changing or cancelling a reservation, various commenters expressed support for it and stated that clear disclosure upfront of these prohibitions is necessary to avoid consumer harm. Southwest Airlines explained that basic economy fares are increasingly common and likely to appeal to occasional, less savvy budget travelers, making early disclosure that these tickets cannot be changed or canceled and that passengers cannot travel with a carry-on bag or checked bag if that is the case especially necessary. Southwest Airlines added that because the least expensive basic economy tickets often are at the top of search results, it is particularly important to provide complete and timely notice of such restrictions on all distribution channels. FlyersRights and Travelers United recommended that the Department require a clear disclosure for fares that prohibit ticket changes or cancellations, similar to the disclosure proposed for fares that prohibit baggage. DOT Response: This final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to clearly and conspicuously disclose accurate fees for all critical ancillary services (i.e., a first checked bag, a second checked bag, a carry-on bag, ticket change, and ticket cancellation) on the airline\u2019s or ticket agent\u2019s website at the time fare and schedule information is initially provided when a consumer conducts a search for air transportation. The Department acknowledges the concern of airline commenters that ancillary packages or subscriptions that allow passengers to have unlimited checked baggage for an annual fee or bundle baggage fees with other ancillary services such as wi-fi or food would make displaying baggage fees on the first page of search results more challenging. The Department is clarifying that, while airlines and ticket agents must disclose the standalone fees for critical ancillary services required under this rule, they are not required to disclose the ancillary service packages or bundles that include one or more critical ancillary services but may do so if they choose. The Department disagrees with those commenters who stated that the Department should allow fee information for critical ancillary services to be displayed later in the booking process, after consumers have already spent time selecting an itinerary based on incomplete fee information. The challenges cited by Air Canada and IATA that industry faces in calculating baggage fees favors requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose these fees to consumers, rather than placing the burden on consumers to make complex calculations. Regarding Air Canada\u2019s request for clarification of the meaning of \u201cwhen fare and schedule information is first provided,\u201d that phrase means the first point at which a fare is quoted for a particular flight itinerary. This first point will typically be the first page of search results provided in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search. The Department disagrees with A4A that displaying baggage fee information when schedule and fare information is first provided will confuse consumers that payment of such fees is mandatory. Many industry commenters touted their ability to design innovative and clear web displays, and the Department expects that the industry will use those skills to meet the disclosure requirements of this rule in a manner that mitigates the potential for consumer confusion. The Department acknowledges NACA\u2019s statement that E.O. 14036 does not require the Department to mandate disclosure of critical ancillary fees at the first point in the search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. For the reasons discussed in this preamble, however, the Department has determined that disclosure of critical ancillary fees at that point is necessary to mitigate unfair and deceptive practices and that the requirements in this final rule are consistent with the E.O. The Department does not adopt the alternatives to providing itinerary- and passenger- specific change and cancellation fees recommended by some industry commenters, such as requiring airlines and ticket agents to display the factors used by the airline to set the relevant change and cancellation fees (rather than the fees themselves), a single change or cancellation fee (rather than all change and cancellation fees), or minimum and maximum change and cancellation fees. Each of those recommended alternatives would result in disclosure that is insufficiently precise to advise consumers of the true cost of selecting a particular itinerary. In response to the ACPAC recommendation, the Department notes that this final rule does not mandate change and cancellation fee disclosures to be displayed in a consistent manner or use standardized definitions. The Department is of the view that, so long as the required information is presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, there is no identified consumer harm from ticket agents developing their own displays. The Department believes that the requirement in this rule to disclose a summary of the applicable change and cancellation policies will be sufficient to clarify any potential inconsistencies in the presentation of such fees. Should the Department determine in the future that a problem regarding the consistency of critical ancillary service fee disclosures exist, the Department may revisit this issue. The requests by AARP and others that the Department work to eliminate change and cancellation fees are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. The Department acknowledges concerns raised by commenters about the cost and technological feasibility of providing all critical ancillary fee information in text form where an airline or ticket agent first provides fare and schedule information in response to a consumer\u2019s itinerary search. To address these concerns, the Department is providing additional flexibility for ticket agents and airlines in how they disclose the required fees. This final rule requires that fees be \u201cclearly and conspicuously\u201d disclosed but does not limit the display of critical ancillary fees to only static text next to the fare. While the final rule continues to prohibit display of fees for critical ancillary services by links, the Department is not prohibiting the use of pop-ups or other methods to avoid the page clutter problems that commenters identified. To further explain this requirement, the final rule defines \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d to mean that a disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily noticeable), easily understandable by ordinary consumers, and presented in a manner that allows ordinary consumers to determine the true cost of travel. In other words, it should be readily apparent to a consumer that fee information is available, the process for calling up such information should be uncomplicated, and the fee information should be understandably presented. Also, the fees themselves and how to access them should not be hidden or involve significant effort to ascertain by the consumer. Further, the consumer\u2019s booking process should not be disrupted in such a way that causes the consumer to have to start over their search process from the beginning or to lose their location on the page being viewed. The rule prohibits airlines and ticket agents from displaying critical ancillary fees by hyperlink because displaying fees in that manner would disrupt the consumer\u2019s search. To evaluate whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous, the Department intends to consider the clarity of the fee disclosure (whether in text or through a pop-up, in expandable text, or by other means); the font size used for the disclosure compared with other text on the page; and the placement of the disclosure on the page, among other information. Provided that the fees for critical ancillary services are disclosed in a manner that meets the regulatory criteria of clear and conspicuous and not provided by hyperlink, airlines and ticket agents have the flexibility to display or disclose these fees through various methods, including in text form on the page with the fare, through a pop-up, or other method that does not navigate the consumer away from the page and place on the page being viewed at the time the user action is taken, or through expandable text on the page where the fare is displayed. The Department concludes that these modifications from the proposal will better enable industry to use innovative web design to display fees in a manner that is technologically feasible while still ensuring that consumers are provided with critical information about the true cost of travel at the time of itinerary search. Given the increased flexibility afforded by this final rule compared to the initial proposal, as sought by many commenters, the Department concludes that compliance should be feasible and reduce the potential for slow  times or cluttered or confusing displays for consumers. Also, as proposed, the Department is requiring that airlines and ticket agents disclose to consumers if a particular fare category prohibits the checking of a first or second checked bag or the carriage of a carry-on bag and display the penalty, if applicable, for carrying on or checking the item. The Department is also adopting its proposal to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose upfront whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed. The Department agrees with commenters who stated that it is particularly important for airlines and ticket agents to disclose that a given fare prohibits changes and cancellations if that is the case. Under this final rule, airlines and ticket agents are required to disclose that a particular fare category prohibits a first checked bag, a second checked bag, a carry-on bag, ticket change, or ticket cancellation, if that is the case, when fare and schedule information is provided during an itinerary search. The disclosures must be clear and not mislead consumers into believing that the fee for a particular fare category is zero, when in fact a bag or ticket change or cancellation is simply prohibited. Finally, we note that this rule\u2019s disclosure requirements for critical ancillary fees and policies must also be reflected in carriers\u2019 customer service plans. By adding an assurance in their plans, carriers commit to consumers that they will meet the minimum standards set forth in this rule regarding the disclosure of critical ancillary fees and policies. This customer service commitment is merely reinforcing new requirements imposed elsewhere in this final rule. (b) Website Disclosure of Policies DOT Proposal: The Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents disclose, along with the fare and schedule information, the policies applicable to transporting a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on as well as changing and cancelling a reservation, taking into account the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific information, if provided. For baggage, the Department proposed that carriers and ticket agents must display the weight and dimension limitations that a carrier imposes for each checked and carry-on bag, with passenger- specific adjustments if applicable. For ticket changes and cancellations, the Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents provide a summary of the ticket change and cancellation policies applicable to the consumer\u2019s chosen itinerary and fare category, considering the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific information, if provided. The Department proposed to allow carriers and ticket agents to display policy information for baggage, ticket changes, and ticket cancellations using links or pop-ups adjacent to the display of the pertinent fee. In the NPRM, the Department explained that these brief policy summaries should include clear, adequate notice of the rules applicable to the chosen itinerary and fare category, including whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed (as well as when and in what circumstances they are allowed), the form that refunds or airline credits may be provided (e.g., travel voucher or a credit to the original form of payment), any prohibitions or  that may limit the ability to change or cancel a ticket, and other information. The Department did not propose specific requirements for how carriers and ticket agents should address the need for passengers to pay a fare difference between the old and new ticket prices in the event of a change but requested comment on that issue. The Department also asked about consumer confusion from the material change in fare that occurs with many ticket changes being a larger component of the overall price relative to the change fee itself. Comments: Air Canada asked for additional clarification, including \u201cwhether baggage fees that must be displayed also include additional costs associated with those bags. For example, is it an obligation to display excess baggage and overweight fees or is it appropriate that these fees are charged at the airport when the baggage is dropped off?\u201d On the method of displaying baggage policy information, the ACPAC recommended that the Department retain its proposal that pop-ups and links are acceptable for specific information about size and dimension allowances for baggage in any final rule. At the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, the ACPAC Chair, who is the member representing state and local governments, stated that it should be acceptable to provide baggage size policies by link because the average flyer has an understanding of what constitutes an oversized bag. The member representing airports agreed, adding that much baggage comes in standard sizes. Travel Tech also supported this proposal. For policies applicable to changes and cancellations, among industry commenters, IATA objected to the requirement for air carriers and ticket agents to provide a brief summary of the applicable change and cancellation policy, stating that \u201c[a]irlines are under no obligation to provide passengers explanations as to why they are imposing fees on passengers who decide on their own not to use a particular ticket.\u201d Representing consumers, FlyersRights asked the Department to require that airlines and ticket agents display information on whether any refund provided would be as a cash or a cash equivalent, non-expiring travel credits or vouchers, or expiring travel credits or vouchers, and whether those amounts would be for the entire ticket price less the change or cancellation fee or discounted. The Department received a few responses to its request for comment on the issue of fare differentials. Air Canada noted that most of the cost to change a flight would be due to the fare differential. Other commenters noted that, given that fare differentials may be a part of the cost to change tickets, it was not possible to disclose the full cost of a ticket change at the time of ticket purchase, since the full cost may not be known until the consumer changes their ticket. In addition, Travelport stated that \u201cfare differentials due to dynamic pricing are common knowledge,\u201d and deemed a requirement to disclose that a fare differential may apply \u201cunnecessary.\u201d In contrast, FlyersRights requested that the Department require disclosure that a fare differential may apply and whether the airline or ticket agent would refund the fare difference if the replacement flight was less costly than the originally purchased flight. Regarding the method of displaying policy information on ticket changes and cancellations, the ACPAC recommended that the Department retain its proposal that change or cancellation policy information may be displayed by links or pop-ups in any final rule. The ACPAC also recommended that the Department provide greater clarification on the specific location rollovers or pop-ups should be placed for consumers to view additional change or cancellation policy information. Travel Tech commented that the Department should permit disclosure of change and cancellation policies by links or pop-ups as proposed. In addition, Travel Tech opposed the ACPAC recommendation regarding the specific location rollovers or pop-ups should be placed and asserted that the Department should allow flexibility instead. DOT Response: The Department largely maintains the proposed requirements for the disclosure of baggage and ticket change and cancellation policies applicable to the itinerary, taking into account the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific information, if affirmatively provided.99 The Department is adopting its proposal requiring that the weight and dimension limitations that the carrier imposes for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags be disclosed, with passenger-specific adjustments, if applicable. The Department has determined that the failure to provide weight and dimension information before ticket purchase is an unfair practice, as discussed in section D (1)(a). The Department is not requiring that airlines and ticket agents disclose the fees for excess and overweight baggage as part of the required disclosure on weight and dimension limitations. The Department makes clear in this final rule that the disclosure of baggage, change, and cancellation policies must be accurate as well as clear and conspicuous. Unlike the fees themselves, however, the Department allows as proposed the use of links for these policies. Allowing the option for airlines and ticket agents to provide these disclosures by hyperlink was recommended by the ACPAC and supported by public comment. Further, to reduce screen clutter, the Department is allowing summaries of applicable baggage, change, and cancellation policies to be disclosed any time before ticket purchase, rather than requiring them to be disclosed contemporaneously with the fees as proposed. The Department is persuaded by commenters that providing the policy information later in the purchasing process will not harm consumers. The Department concludes that the requirement to provide these policies in a clear 99 Passenger-specific requirements are discussed in section E (5). and conspicuous manner, as defined in this final rule and further explained in section E (4)(a) of this preamble, provides adequate information regarding where and how baggage and change and cancellation policies must be disclosed, while maintaining flexibility for airlines and ticket agents to develop their own consumer-friendly displays. Regarding change and cancellation policy summaries, the Department disagrees with IATA\u2019s interpretation of the NPRM proposal. The Department did not propose to require carriers to disclose \u201cwhy they are imposing\u201d change and cancellation fees, but instead proposed that carriers and ticket agents should disclose, among other information, whether ticket changes and cancellations are permitted, the  under which change and cancellation fees would apply, and the form of any refund provided. The Department is adopting this proposal in this final rule. More specifically, given that the Department\u2019s conclusion that change and cancellation fees are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision, the Department is identifying in this final rule the types of information that must be included in the summaries of change and cancellation policies. First, the Department agrees with those commenters who stated that it is particularly important for airlines and ticket agents to disclose that a given fare prohibits change and cancellations if that is the case (as discussed in section E 4(a)), and so this final rule requires any prohibitions or  that may limit a consumer\u2019s ability to change or cancel a ticket to be clearly and conspicuously provided in the summary of the change or cancellation policy. In addition, the final rule requires, as suggested by FlyersRights, that airlines and ticket agents disclose the form of the refund or credit that would be provided in the event a change or cancellation is permitted. Finally, the change and cancellation summary must include notice that the consumer is responsible for any fare differential if that is the case. As noted by Air Canada, a large portion of the cost for a passenger to change their flight in many cases could be the fare differential. Given the potentially significant cost of fare differentials, the Department concludes that it would be deceptive to disclose a change fee without also disclosing that the passenger may also be required to pay the difference in fare. As such, the Department does not believe that this disclosure is unnecessary, as urged by Travelport, and, accordingly, the final rule requires this additional disclosure. Further, the Department agrees with FlyersRights that the airline or ticket agent must disclose whether it will refund the difference in fare if the consumer changes their flight and selects a less costly replacement flight. This disclosure must be provided in the change policy. The Department has determined that the failure to provide the change and cancellation policy information required by this rule before ticket purchase is an unfair and deceptive practice, as discussed in section D (1)(b). (c) Mobile Site and App Disclosure of Fees and Policies Proposal: The Department proposed to require disclosure of fees and policies for ancillary services critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary on airlines\u2019 and ticket agents\u2019 websites, including mobile websites. In the NPRM, the Department noted that consumers increasingly use mobile devices to book travel, and so it is important that the same disclosures provided on airlines\u2019 and ticket agents\u2019 desktop websites are also provided on mobile websites. While the Department did not propose to require critical ancillary fee and policy disclosures on airlines\u2019 and ticket agents\u2019 mobile apps, it sought comment on whether to extend the proposal to mobile apps and whether there are any practical distinctions between information accessed on mobile websites and mobile apps. Comments: Multiple commenters provided data through their written comments and at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing regarding the frequency with which consumers book air travel on mobile websites and apps. AELP testified that 70 percent of consumers research travel on mobile devices. IATA provided the same statistic in its comments and further noted that 44 percent of online bookings were completed on mobile devices, citing a 2022 report. Priceline testified that more than half of its business is from mobile customers, Google stated that 68 percent of its users browse on mobile devices, and Hopper reported that its entire business is conducted \u201cexclusively through the Hopper mobile app.\u201d A joint comment from multiple consumer groups noted that the top five free travel apps that sell airline tickets through the Apple operating system, iOS, have a combined 13.6 million user ratings, demonstrating that such apps have reached millions of consumers. Industry commenters opposed both the proposed requirement that airlines and ticket agents disclose all critical ancillary fees at the first page of search results on mobile websites and the extension of that proposal to cover mobile apps. These commenters noted that challenges with screen clutter are particularly acute on mobile devices and apps, which have limited screen space, and stated that the proposed requirement would likely limit the number of search results provided or require excessive scrolling on mobile apps and websites. In addition, Air Canada asserted that ATPCO was never designed to work in conjunction with mobile apps and therefore there is an inherent level of disconnect in the transferability of information between ATPCO and mobile apps. Further, Travel Tech stated that accommodating screen readers for individuals with disabilities on mobile devices would be more difficult given the volume of information required at the first page of search results under the proposal. Some industry commenters, including Frontier Airlines, Campbell-Hill Aviation Group (on behalf of A4A), Sprit Airlines, and Google, provided visual illustrations to demonstrate the challenges of displaying first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag fees, change and cancellation fees, and family seating fees on the first page of mobile search results. For example, in Google\u2019s presentation at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing, it provided a sample mobile display it had created which it stated would require both horizontal and vertical scrolling for a consumer to see all ancillary fees required by the NPRM at the first page of search results. A few commenters stated that challenges in displaying information on mobile devices would only continue to grow with continued technological evolution. For example, Amadeus testified that in the future more consumers will book air travel through mobile devices or other devices, such as wearables, with very small screens that might provide search results in the form of a voice message. Similarly, IATA noted that consumers are \u201cincreasingly conducting ticket searches via voice recognition, with the only major impediment being too much information to sort through.\u201d IATA stated that a requirement that all ancillary fee data be provided on the initial search page would inhibit consumer-friendly innovation. Travelers United expressed concern about the Department\u2019s ability to adapt its rule to future technology such as artificial intelligence. This comment observed that by the time the rule takes effect, \u201cnew technology will be leading us in a different direction.\u201d American Airlines and Hopper submitted comments addressing how the functionality of mobile devices differs from traditional desktop websites. American Airlines stated that carriers provide similar functionalities for mobile devices as for desktop websites and that those mobile functionalities \u201callow the consumer to view or hide information at the consumer\u2019s choosing, even if a mobile device does not have a cursor.\u201d This comment further explained: \u201cin lieu of \u2018hovering,\u2019 [for mobile devices] American [Airlines] will provide a dropdown arrow which the consumer can click to display or hide the relevant information. These dropdown arrows are familiar and intuitive to consumers and provide the same benefits as rollovers.\u201d Hopper commented that rollovers, hyperlinks, and non-adjacent disclosures are ineffective on mobile websites and apps, but other comparable methods can be implemented by travel agencies for mobile websites and apps if the final rule \u201cis not overly proscriptive.\u201d Hopper stated that \u201cusing expandable native results boxes\u201d is \u201can effective approach\u201d for mobile devices. Industry commenters suggested different approaches for whether and how the final rule\u2019s requirements should apply to mobile apps and websites. American Airlines favored applying the same requirements to desktop and mobile displays, noting that different disclosures would be costly to develop and \u201cfar more confusing for the consumers who would receive different disclosures depending on the portal they use.\u201d Other industry commenters asked the Department to either exclude mobile apps from the final rule entirely or to allow more flexibility or more limited disclosures on mobile devices. For example, NACA recommended permitting links to critical ancillary fee information on mobile apps given limited screen space. Air Canada asked that DOT not extend the rule\u2019s requirements to mobile apps, other than a possible disclosure that \u201cadditional fees may apply\u201d or directing the passenger to the carrier\u2019s website. Observing that \u201cmobile apps are not scaled-down versions of desktop websites but rather use display formats that are uniquely designed to make information more accessible,\u201d Travel Tech asked DOT to exclude mobile apps from the final rule to allow engineers to develop innovative displays for apps. Like Travel Tech, Hopper requested \u201cflexibility for agents to design new and innovative methods for serving their customers on mobile devices.\u201d Hopper asked that both mobile websites and apps be excluded from any requirement to provide disclosure at the first page of search results and that disclosure instead be required prior to the time of purchase for mobile devices and apps. Among groups representing consumers, AARP and a joint comment from multiple consumer groups supported covering mobile apps in the final rule. However, Travelers United expressed concern about the possibility of screen clutter on mobile devices. The joint comment from multiple consumer groups urged the Department to cover mobile apps to avoid excluding from fee disclosures the millions of consumers who book flights via mobile apps. That comment further noted that \u201cmobile apps are just as capable of disseminating airlines\u2019 unfair and deceptive commercial practices\u201d as mobile websites or desktop websites and have expanded reach due to push notifications. Finally, this comment explained that many consumers, especially those who are younger or low income, are likely to rely on smartphones as their primary internet connection, and so the final rule should cover mobile applications to avoid \u201cdisproportionately exclud[ing] these populations.\u201d AARP suggested that DOT could allow opt-outs or links and rollovers for mobile devices. The few individual commenters who addressed coverage of mobile apps recommended different approaches. Individuals recommending that the Department cover mobile apps stated that covering mobile apps was necessary given increased use of those apps by consumers, to avoid misleading and confusing consumers by providing different information on various platforms, and because mobile apps provide a more \u201caccessible\u201d interface for users than mobile websites. One individual commenter, however, expressed concern about screen clutter on mobile apps due to the proposed requirement to display all critical ancillary fee data at the first page of search results. DOT Response: Under this final rule, airlines and ticket agents must provide the same disclosures for critical ancillary service fees and policies on all online platforms. As commenters explained, consumers now widely use mobile websites and apps to shop for and purchase air transportation. The Department agrees with commenters who stated that it would be confusing to have different critical ancillary fee requirements for mobile apps than for mobile and desktop websites. Further, the Department concludes that excluding airline and ticket agent apps from this rule\u2019s requirement to disclose ancillary fee data that the Department has determined is critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions would not sufficiently protect consumers who use mobile apps to purchase air transportation. Several commenters noted that methods of consumer search are evolving to include wearable devices, artificial intelligence, and voice recognition technology. To adequately cover desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps, and other technologies in this final rule, the Department uses the term \u201conline platform\u201d This term is defined as \u201cany interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent.\u201d The Department makes modifications from the proposal in this final rule that mitigate the concerns raised by commenters about the volume of information required to be disclosed at the first point in the search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. This final rule does not require airlines and ticket agents that sell air transportation to display family seating fees, which the Department had proposed. In addition, while fees for critical ancillary services must still be disclosed at the first point in the search process where a fare is provided in connection with a specific flight itinerary, this final rule provides significant flexibility to airlines and ticket agents regarding the method of displaying that information so long as it is displayed in a clear and conspicuous manner and not by hyperlinks. This allowance includes the option to use expandable native results boxes or dropdown arrows on mobile websites and apps, which as described in comments from American Airlines and Hopper, is the type of flexibility that would permit airlines and ticket agents to produce innovative, consumer- friendly ancillary fee displays without overwhelming consumers, unduly cluttering search results, or limiting the number of search results. These same flexibilities apply to desktops, mobile apps, and other online platforms. Further, to reduce screen clutter, the Department is allowing summaries of baggage, change, and cancellation policies to be disclosed any time before ticket purchase, rather than requiring them to be disclosed contemporaneously with the fees as proposed. (d) In-Person and Telephone Disclosure of Fees Proposal: The Department proposed disclosure of critical ancillary service fees for tickets purchased by telephone or in-person like those proposed for online purchases. Under the proposal, ticket agents and airlines would be required to disclose to consumers shopping in- person or by phone the fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on bags, ticket changes and cancellations, and family seating that apply to an itinerary for which a fare is quoted to the consumer. The Department proposed to require ticket agents and carriers to provide this ancillary fee information for offline transactions when schedule information is provided during the \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cdecision making\u201d portion of the transaction. The Department explained its proposal would not allow ticket agents and carriers to wait to provide this information until after the consumer has decided to make a reservation or purchase a ticket. The Department solicited comment on alternative options for providing fee information on the phone or in person (e.g., explaining that fees may apply and referring the consumer to the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s website, provided that the website is accessible to consumers with disabilities). Comments: The ACPAC recommended that the Department retain its proposal to require disclosure of fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag when a fare is quoted to a consumer during an in-person or telephone inquiry. The ACPAC did not adopt as a recommendation a suggestion from ticket agents that DOT modify its proposal to require bag fees and ticket change and cancellation fees to be provided \u201cupon request\u201d for offline transactions. At the January 12, 2023, ACPAC meeting, the member representing consumers expressed concern that the suggestion by ticket agents to provide baggage fees only upon request could lead to consumers having an incorrect understanding of the cost of the itinerary selected, and the member representing airport operators noted that the ticket agent suggestion regarding baggage fees appeared to conflict with the proposed requirement that ticket agents must refund baggage fees not disclosed during the ticket purchase process. Regarding change and cancellation fees, the ACPAC member representing consumers stated that consumers in offline transactions should not have less information than those who transact online, and the member representing state and local governments noted that seniors and low-income individuals may not have access to or knowledge of online booking tools and stated that those individuals were no less deserving of or interested in fee information than those searching online. Similarly, AARP supported DOT\u2019s proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to provide critical ancillary fee information at the time that schedule information is provided to the consumer for offline transactions. AARP stated that \u201cdue to disability, lack of access, or simply preference, some consumers will seek fare information by phone or in person\u201d and noted that these same factors \u201cwould likely inhibit [those consumers] from looking for the fee disclosures online.\u201d An individual commenter similarly requested that the Department require disclosure of critical ancillary fee information during phone bookings, stating that disclosure is necessary for accessibility and equal access to information for consumers using offline booking channels. This commenter stated that the alternative of referring offline consumers to a website for ancillary fee information improperly places the burden on consumers to obtain fees when the burden should rest with sellers of air transportation. Industry commenters generally opposed the proposal to require affirmative disclosure of first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag fees, change and cancellation fees, and family seating fees at the time that fare and schedule information is provided during offline transactions. These commenters expressed concerns about the effect that the proposed offline disclosures would have on the ability to maintain reasonable wait times and assist passengers in a timely manner, with IATA noting that such concerns would be particularly acute when serving travelers at the ticket counter. Airlines further stated that the requirement to provide potentially dozens of critical ancillary fees would confuse and overwhelm passengers, and Air Canada asserted that it is likely that consumers preferring phone or in-person services are not looking to compare prices. ASTA estimated that the proposed disclosures would add at least 20 seconds to each offline transaction by ticket agents at an estimated cost of $21.3 million per year in \u201ctalk time\u201d for agents. Industry commenters recommended alternatives to the Department\u2019s proposal for offline disclosures. Ticket agents and their associations generally suggested that DOT should require airlines and ticket agents to provide ancillary fee disclosures \u201cupon request,\u201d rather than affirmatively. For example, ASTA stated that requiring ancillary fee disclosures for offline transactions only upon request \u201cwould allow ticket agents to use their professional judgement as to the fee-related information their clients need when such information is not specifically requested,\u201d with different levels of information appropriate for seasoned and infrequent travelers. TMC suggested that the Department allow airlines and ticket agents to direct consumers to an online source for fee information, such as \u201can airline\u2019s website, a corporate travel booking tool, or other available reference.\u201d Similarly, some airlines and their associations asked the Department to allow carriers to advise passengers that additional fees may apply and direct passengers to an airline website for detailed ancillary fee disclosures. IATA asked that DOT allow disclosure that additional fees may apply \u201ceither to begin the call or during the time the customer is holding for an agent.\u201d GBTA recommended that the Department consider requiring disclosure of a \u201ctotal likely price\u201d after the agent obtains information on whether the consumer plans to check a bag. DOT Response: After carefully considering the comments, the Department is modifying its proposal for offline transactions in this final rule to require airlines and ticket agents to disclose critical ancillary fees to consumers who request them following disclosure that such fees apply to the searched itinerary. Specifically, the airline or ticket agent must disclose in an offline transaction that baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees apply when a fare is quoted with an itinerary if that is the case, and ask the consumer if they wish to hear the specific baggage fees, change or cancellation fees, and any other critical ancillary service fees that apply. If the consumer requests information about a single or multiple critical ancillary fees, then the airline or ticket agent must disclose the requested information that applies to the fare and itinerary quoted, adjusted based on any passenger-specific information provided by the consumer. The Department agrees with comments stating that requiring disclosure of critical ancillary fee information for all possible flight options to all offline consumers at the time that schedule information is provided might significantly increase hold times and delay airlines and ticket agents in assisting consumers. Therefore, the Department is permitting such offline disclosures to be made upon the consumer\u2019s request, provided that affirmative notice is given that a fee applies to the quoted itinerary. The Department disagrees with comments asking that it authorize airlines and ticket agents to refer passengers who seek booking assistance offline to critical ancillary fee information in online sources or that it should allow ticket sellers to provide this information only upon request without any affirmative disclosure required. While carrier websites must be accessible for passengers with disabilities,100 the Department agrees with 100 14 CFR 382.43(c). AARP that the same factors that lead some consumers to seek offline information about schedules and fares may also inhibit those consumers seeking critical ancillary fee information online, and so the recommendation to refer consumers to online sources would not appropriately address the needs of passengers. In addition, because fees for change and cancellation are often provided as a range on airline websites, finding the specific applicable change or cancellation fee for an itinerary quoted offline would be impracticable. The Department\u2019s requirement that sellers of air transportation inform consumers in offline transactions that bag fees and change and cancellation fees apply to a particular itinerary is intended to provide consumers notice that a specific itinerary being quoted to them carries additional fees for these ancillary services. It is not sufficient to provide a generic disclosure that \u201cadditional fees may apply,\u201d as recommended by IATA. Such a statement provides little useful information to consumers searching for the total cost of an itinerary and does not indicate what fees apply or the amount of those fees. The Department found that a similar notice in online search tools, as required by existing regulation, was equally insufficient. As provided in this final rule, the requirement is to provide a statement that bag fees, change fees, and cancellation fees apply to a specific itinerary being quoted, if that is the case. If, for the quoted itinerary, there is no additional charge for the consumer to check one or two bags or to bring on-board a carry-on bag, or to change or cancel the ticket, then no statement about these fees need be made in association with the quoted itinerary. If, however, a fee for one or more critical ancillary services applies to the quoted itinerary, then, under the requirement in this rule, the airline or ticket agent must notify the consumer that an additional fee applies for baggage or change or cancellation and permit the consumer to request the fee information. If the consumer requests fee information for any critical ancillary service, the airline or ticket agent must disclose it. The requirement in this rule strikes the appropriate balance between minimizing delays in assisting passengers at the ticket counter or by phone and ensuring that consumers receive critical ancillary fee information. The Department does not adopt GBTA\u2019s proposal to permit airlines and ticket agents to quote a \u201ctotal likely price\u201d based on whether a consumer plans to check a bag because that proposal does not address all critical ancillary fee information nor would the allowance for a \u201clikely\u201d price quote allow a passenger to assess the true cost of air travel. (5) Passenger-Specific and Anonymous Search Fee Disclosures Proposal: The Department proposed to require passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary search disclosure of critical ancillary service fees, based on the consumer\u2019s choice, whenever fare and schedule information is provided. For searches where the passenger elects to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent, such as frequent flyer status, payment method, or military status, the Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents display the fees for critical ancillary services in the form of passenger-specific charges for the itinerary. The Department proposed to treat a search as passenger-specific if a user provided passenger-specific information to the airline or ticket agent before conducting the search \u201cincluding when conducting previous searches if the information is cached, or if the user conducts a search while logged into the search website and the operating entity of that website has passenger-specific information as part of the user\u2019s profile.\u201d101 If the consumer conducting a search elects not to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent (i.e., the consumer conducts an \u201canonymous itinerary search\u201d), then the Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents to display the fees for critical ancillary services as itinerary-specific charges. Comments: The ACPAC recommended that the Department maintain its proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to display passenger-specific baggage and change and cancellation fees in any final rule. At the January 12, 2023, meeting, the ACPAC member representing airlines stated that providing passenger-specific fees increases the complexity of the search process. He urged ACPAC members to consider the amount of information required to be 101 87 FR 63736. presented to consumers under the NPRM and the impact these disclosures could have on the speed of providing search results to consumers given the number of ancillary fees required to be displayed at the time schedule and fare information is first provided. In their written comments and hearing testimony, other industry commenters also opposed the requirement to provide passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services. These commenters stated that passengers who have status with an airline already know about the benefits associated with their status, and so the disclosure would have little benefit for those consumers. The commenters added that it was impractical for consumers to provide ticket agents with all possible loyalty numbers before conducting a search. They further added that it was technologically infeasible to comply with the passenger-specific requirement, particularly on the first page of search results, with many citing concerns about technology for ticket agents to validate the passenger\u2019s status before displaying passenger-specific fees. For example, Booking Holdings stated that \u201cto enable passenger-specific displays that would need validation from airlines (e.g., frequent flyer account status and credit card affinity status) or third parties (e.g., military status), would be technically prohibitive.\u201d Booking Holdings added that, without validation of information provided by the consumer, there is a risk that online travel agents would provide incorrect information to consumers about applicable fees. Similarly, American Airlines testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing about challenges with validating passenger status using the EDIFACT platform and stated that querying and displaying passenger-specific fees at the first page of search results would affect the reliability and speed of search results. American Airlines further acknowledged in its comments, however, that it currently provides passenger-specific information \u201cto the extent technologically feasible,\u201d including seat and bag fees for passengers with status logged in to the airline\u2019s website and military personnel who access the American Airlines site through a military booking channel. Echoing concerns raised by other commenters, American Airlines stated that other passenger-specific fee information is impracticable to provide at the first page of search results because it cannot be validated at that time, citing the example of military status for individuals booking travel outside of an official military booking channel. In addition, Google expressed concern about consumer  if metasearch entities were required to collect and share customer data with airlines and ticket agents to comply with the passenger-specific search requirement. Ticket agents uniformly expressed concerns about the volume of queries they would need to conduct to provide passenger-specific information. For example, USTOA commented that \u201cthe volume of data transmission necessary to provide for the level of specificity [for passenger- specific fees] contemplated under the proposed rule is unmanageably large and complex,\u201d noting that there are currently 47 different co-branded credit cards for \u201cmajor\u201d U.S. airlines, with various policies across airlines regarding when the airline waives the passenger\u2019s bag fee (e.g., some credit cards entitle a passenger\u2019s travel companion to a free bag, while others do not). Similarly, Sabre commented that the proposed rule required passenger-specific information for too many passenger characteristics and added that it was unclear that the list of passenger- specific criteria in the NPRM was exhaustive. In addition, Sabre expressed concern that the requirement to provide passenger-specific ancillary fee information could lead to providing inapplicable fee information if only one passenger in a travel party has status or if status is lost between the time of booking and travel. Further, Travel Tech stated that \u201cticket agents would need to receive a huge volume of data from airlines for this proposal to work, but systems to exchange vast amounts of passenger-specific status information between airlines, agents and GDSs do not currently exist.\u201d Given the concerns raised by ticket agents, Booking Holdings requested that DOT not require passenger-specific disclosures, at least until new systems could be developed, and asked the Department to modify the proposal to require airlines and ticket agents to inform passengers how fees may differ based on frequent flyer privileges, military status, and other factors, instead of providing specific fees. A joint comment from multiple consumer groups stated that the options for anonymous and passenger-specific searches \u201cwill be beneficial to consumers, allowing them to customize their purchasing process.\u201d This comment further stated that any additional time necessary to implement passenger-specific requirements should not be used to delay the implementation timeline for the rest of the NPRM\u2019s requirements. Travelers United stated that passenger-specific characteristics can make a significant difference in determining the total price of an airfare but noted that the complexity of ancillary fee structures makes providing that information on a single page \u201cdifficult, if not impossible with current technology.\u201d DOT Response: This final rule maintains, with modifications, the requirement for airlines and ticket agents to provide passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services if the consumer elects to provide passenger-specific information, and to provide itinerary-specific fees for critical ancillary services if the consumer does not do so. The Department clarifies that the list of information specific to the passenger provided in the rule text\u2014frequent flyer status, military status, and credit card status\u2014is illustrative and not exhaustive. Because variation in fees within each carrier depends on the status of the passenger, fares provided without additional disclosure of the critical ancillary fees specific to the passenger fail to provide consumers with adequate notice of the total cost of the air transportation. Disclosure of the passenger-specific fees will promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The Department disagrees with comments stating that the complexity of airline policies for assessing passenger-specific fees or the number of queries that must be conducted to produce passenger-specific fees counsels against adopting a passenger-specific fee requirement. Ancillary fee structures that ticket agents or airlines find complex to administer are likely to lead to consumer confusion regarding fees. The costly and time-consuming burdens of determining passenger-specific fees are currently borne by consumers, a key harm that the Department seeks to remedy in this final rule, and makes disclosure of such fees necessary, even for experienced travelers with airline status. In addition, this final rule allows additional flexibility for industry beyond what was proposed, which will reduce the burdens to airlines and ticket agents in disclosing passenger-specific fees for critical ancillary services. Further, many of the commenters who opposed the requirement to provide passenger- specific fees appear to believe that the proposal would require airlines and ticket agents to validate the passenger-specific information provided by the consumer before displaying itinerary search results. Those comments misunderstood the Department\u2019s proposal. Neither the NPRM nor this final rule would require an airline or ticket agent to verify passenger-provided information before disclosing critical ancillary fees when schedule and fare information is provided. To address this misunderstanding, in this final rule, the Department clarifies that the disclosure of critical ancillary fees to consumers may be based on information provided by consumers. If a consumer elects to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent, that consumer has a responsibility for ensuring the information provided is accurate. An airline or ticket agent that relies on the information provided by a consumer when disclosing the critical ancillary service fees applicable to that consumer would not be in violation of the requirement for the fee information to be accurate should the consumer provide inaccurate information (e.g., incorrect frequent flyer account status or credit card affinity status). An airline or ticket agent may elect to verify passenger-provided information at the point that the critical ancillary service is purchased rather than at the time of itinerary search. While this may result in the passenger later being charged a different fee than what was disclosed during the initial search (e.g., if the passenger entered erroneous passenger-specific information), such harm is reasonably avoidable by the consumer providing the airline or ticket agent with accurate passenger-specific information. The Department concludes that it is feasible for airlines and ticket agents to provide passenger-specific information as required by this final rule. American Airlines\u2019 comment suggests that it already provides much of the passenger-specific ancillary fee information required by the rule, providing strong evidence that the proposal can be implemented. In addition, many consumers, including those with a beneficial status, may choose to conduct an anonymous itinerary search, limiting the potential burden on carriers and ticket agents to conduct passenger-specific adjustments in the aggregate. The barrier that American Airlines identified to passenger-specific fees (i.e., the need for validation of passenger data before the display of fees) is not required for compliance, and the Department expects this fact to further mitigate the concerns of regulated entities regarding potential burdens. In addition, the Department has made several changes and clarifications from the NPRM that address concerns commenters raised about the feasibility of the proposed passenger-specific fee requirement. First, the Department has extended the period for compliance with the final rule\u2019s requirements, as discussed in section F, to allow additional time for data sharing and implementation of the final rule\u2019s requirements. In addition, this final rule does not require airlines and ticket agents to disclose or transact family seating fees, a key area of technical concern for many industry commenters. Further, this final rule provides flexibility in how fee information is displayed so long as the information is accurate, clear, and conspicuous, rather than limiting these disclosures to a display in static text as proposed. The Department expects that these changes will greatly reduce the technological burdens of disclosing passenger-specific fee information when schedule and fare information is provided in response to a consumer\u2019s search. Because this final rule does not require ticket agents to validate passenger-specific data, the  concerns raised by Google do not apply. The Department nonetheless concludes that  concerns could be implicated if an airline or ticket agent treats an itinerary search as \u201cpassenger-specific\u201d based on information not affirmatively provided by the passenger for that search, such as a search based on cached information. Under this rule, a consumer is entitled the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search, which does not consider any passenger- specific information. A consumer should not see a specific fee or ticket price tailored to the consumer if the consumer elects to conduct an anonymous itinerary search. If such a search did, in fact, take into account passenger-specific information not affirmatively provided by the passenger for that search, the Department may take the view that the consumer was not afforded an anonymous itinerary search, which would be a violation of this regulation. Accordingly, this final rule defines a search as passenger-specific only when the search is based on information affirmatively provided by the passenger to the airline or ticket agent for purposes of that search. (6) Opt-Out Provisions Proposal: The Department did not propose to permit airlines and ticket agents to enable consumers to opt out of receiving fee information for any critical ancillary services during the search process. Instead, the Department sought comment on whether to allow carriers and ticket agents to provide consumers an opt-out option from receiving ancillary service fee information that would otherwise be required. The Department explained that opt-out options could potentially include the choice to opt out of seeing all baggage fee information that would otherwise be required to be displayed (first and second checked bag and carry-on bag), to opt out of seeing fee information related to changing or canceling a reservation, to opt out of seeing seat fee information for a child traveling with an adult, or to opt out of seeing some of those fees. Comments: Industry commenters generally supported permitting consumers to opt out of critical ancillary fee disclosures. These commenters stated that experienced travelers aware of airline ancillary fees may want to opt out of disclosures and that allowing consumers to opt out would provide a more efficient search with customized results for consumers. Spirit Airlines commented that a binary choice of whether a consumer wishes to view ancillary fee information provided at the start of the search process avoids any concern about \u201cclick wrap\u201d tactics that do not represent a meaningful choice for consumers. Among industry commenters who recommended variations on this general approach, Booking Holdings recommended that consumers be required to affirmatively opt in to receive critical ancillary fee disclosures, stating that its recommendation was based on studies that demonstrate that schedule and fare are the most important factors in a consumer\u2019s decision. Google supported either an opt-out or opt-in provision for metasearch sites. Groups representing consumers and individual commenters recommended different approaches. AARP recommended allowing opt outs in limited circumstances, stating, for example, it may be acceptable to allow \u201ca traveler to opt out of certain disclosures (such as a single traveler opting out of adjacent seating fee disclosures)\u201d on a mobile app where screen space is limited, but it added that any circumstance in which opt outs are permitted \u201cshould be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d One individual supported allowing consumers to opt out of ancillary fee disclosures based on concern about information overload from disclosure of all critical ancillary fees at the first page of search results. Another opposed opt outs with the view that opt outs improperly empower airlines and ticket agents to frame the question to the user about whether to forgo the otherwise-required information. That individual instead recommended that fees be \u201czeroed out\u201d when both the airline and consumer have reason to believe based on information from the initial fare search or customer profile that the consumer does not need a particular ancillary service. For first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage, the ACPAC recommended that consumers should be given the opportunity to indicate how many bags they will be traveling with early in the itinerary search process, and the fees applicable to the consumers\u2019 selections should then be displayed. This recommendation was proposed by the ACPAC Chair who stated that she did not believe that her recommendation was an opt-in or an opt-out. The ACPAC member representing airlines viewed this proposal as an opt in by consumers and stated that the recommendation was contrary to the Department\u2019s proposal. This member expressed concern about how regulating the search landing page could impact efficient search options currently available to consumers. At the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing, NCL supported the same approach recommended by the ACPAC, and FlyersRights made a similar recommendation in its written comments. Travel Tech objected to the ACPAC recommendation on the basis that, in its view, the recommendation was outside the scope of the NPRM. Travel Tech further commented that the ACPAC recommendation would require ticket agents to redesign their websites to include a bag inquiry, which would require significant resources. Travel Tech asked that ticket agents be provided with flexibility to adopt this method at their option. Regarding change and cancellation fees, the ACPAC recommended that the Department should not provide the option for consumers to opt out of receiving change and cancellation fee information. The ACPAC member representing airport operators stated that because change and cancellation fees are not an a la carte item that consumers select but instead operate as penalties, the Department should require their display with no opt-out allowance. DOT Response: The Department agrees with AARP that enabling opt outs from disclosure of ancillary fees that DOT has determined are critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions \u201cshould be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d Accordingly, this final rule requires airlines and ticket agents to disclose change and cancellation fees to all consumers before ticket purchase without any opt-out allowance. It also prohibits airlines and ticket agents from enabling consumers to opt out of receiving fee information for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag during the search process with one exception. In response to the recommendation by the ACPAC, the Department is allowing an exception to the requirement to disclose fees for transporting a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag on online platforms in circumstances where a consumer affirmatively indicates that no one in their booking party plans to travel with a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on bag. More specifically, under the final rule, a carrier or ticket agent is excepted from the requirement to disclose bag fees with the fare and schedule information if (1) an airline or ticket agent asks its consumers if they intend to travel with a carry-on bag or checked bags; and (2) consumers affirmatively indicate that no one in the booking party intends to travel with a carry- on bag or first or second checked bags. The Department notes that if consumers affirm that they are not traveling with any bags, then the carrier or ticket agent does not have to disclose any of the bag fees. If consumers affirm that they are not traveling with a checked bag, then the carrier or agent is not required to disclose the fees for first or second checking bags. If consumers fail to provide an affirmation, then the carrier and ticket agent must display all the required bag fees. The Department is making this exception available to carriers and ticket agents should they prefer it to providing fees for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag in all instances when fare and schedule information is provided. A carrier or ticket agent that elects to use this exception must still provide the baggage weight and dimension information discussed in section E (4)(b) before ticket purchase so that a consumer has access to information about whether their travel plans are consistent with a particular carrier\u2019s weight and dimension limitations. In contrast to baggage fees, consumers are unlikely to know at the time of booking that they would later need to cancel or change a flight and are unable to opt-out of these fees on an informed basis. As explained in the NPRM, change and cancellation fees can be significant and, in some cases, higher than the original fare paid by the consumer. Accordingly, this final rule does not allow airlines and ticket agents to enable consumers to opt out of disclosure of change and cancellation fees. (7) Transactability Proposal: The Department proposed to require airlines and ticket agents that impose a fee for children 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult to enable the purchase of family seating at the point of ticket purchase (i.e., transactability). The Department explained that transactability is necessary because consumers are not able to save the seat or lock in the price for adjacent seating at the time of ticket purchase. The Department did not prescribe a particular way for the regulated entities to comply. It noted that, to ensure that a consumer receives family seating information as part of the itinerary search results and accompanying fare quotations, a carrier or ticket agent could decide to enable consumers to disclose that a passenger 13 or under will be traveling prior to initiating an itinerary search. The Department also stated that a carrier or ticket agent could alternatively decide to display seating fees for all itinerary searches, regardless of whether a consumer disclosed that a passenger was 13 or under. In contrast, the Department did not propose to require fees for a first checked, second checked, or carry-on bag or a ticket change or cancellation to be transactable at the point of purchase. The Department explained that it has not identified evidence of consumer harm resulting from a lack of transactability of baggage, change, or cancellation fees because these fees cannot increase after ticket purchase. In addition, the Department observed that there is no change or cancellation fee to transact at the point of ticket purchase because the consumer would not know at that time that they will cancel or change the ticket. Comments: Ticket agents, including GDSs, and their associations generally requested that the Department require transactability of all critical ancillary fees, not only fees for children 13 or younger to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult. Representatives of the travel technology industry also made this recommendation at the June 2022 ACPAC meeting.102 Among the concerns expressed by Amadeus, Travelport, Travel Tech, and others were that the inability to purchase ancillary services from ticket agents would drive consumers away from ticket agents, harm the ability of consumers to comparison shop, and result in consumers spending additional time to purchase ancillary services on airline websites after purchasing fares from ticket agents. These commenters stated that consumers might pay more to purchase ancillary services at a later time if the Department elects not to require transactability of all critical ancillary fees. For example, Travel Tech stated that, if airlines are able to quote different baggage fee amounts depending on when the passenger pays for the bag (e.g., a higher fee applies if paid closer to the flight date or at the airport instead of at the time of booking), then the lack of transactability for a first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag could still result in a passenger paying more than they would at the point of ticket purchase. 102 See presentations of ASTA, Travel Tech, and Amadeus, and Skyscanner, available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (June 2022, Day 1 afternoon session). Some ticket agents, including GDSs, and associations also asked the Department to expand the proposed requirement for transactable family seating fees to include all seat fees. For example, Booking Holdings asked DOT to require transactability of all seat fees if DOT maintained the proposed requirement that family seating fees be transactable because the \u201csignificant expense of building the required technology would be offset by greater functionality for most consumers\u201d if the proposal were expanded. Amadeus asserted that there was a particularly strong argument for transactability of all seat fees due to availability and price changes. However, the U.S. Tour Operators Association (USTOA) and others stated that ticket agents currently lack the technology to make seat fees transactable. Airlines and metasearch providers urged the Department not to require transactability of any critical ancillary service fee including family seating fees. For example, IATA and Southwest submitted comments opposing transactability requirements for any ancillary fees. These commenters expressed concern that airlines and ticket agents operate through contractual arrangements and stated that airlines should not be required to contract with third parties to sell airlines services. IATA testified at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, public hearing that travel agent websites would require new digital connections to airlines to display transactable seat fees, which would require years of information technology development. Metasearch providers Skyscanner and Google expressed concern that the proposed rule\u2019s transactability requirement would alter the nature of their business by requiring metasearch sites to sell seating. DOT Response: The Department has decided not to impose any requirement in this final rule that ancillary fees be transactable at the point of ticket purchase. As discussed in section E (3)(c), the Department is not moving forward with its proposal to require carriers and ticket agents disclose fees for young children to be seated next to an accompanying adult on an aircraft and is instead pursuing a separate rulemaking to prohibit these fees.103 Additionally, as discussed 103 See Fall 2023 Unified Agenda for rulemaking titled \u201cFamily Seating in Air Transportation\u201d (RIN 2105-AF15) at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AF15. in section E (3)(d), given that the cost of air transportation includes a seat and the lack of clarity about the importance of seat selection fees to consumers, the Department is not requiring carriers or ticket agents to disclose seating fees as required critical ancillary service fees in this final rule. Further, the Department continues to be of the view that the lack of transactability of baggage, change, or cancellation fees does not harm consumers. The Department is not persuaded by comments asserting that consumers might pay more to purchase ancillary services if the Department elects not to require transactability of all critical ancillary service fees. The Department has identified transporting a first checked, second checked, and/or carry-on bag and changing or canceling a reservation as critical ancillary services. The fee rules for these critical ancillary services do not change after a consumer has purchased a ticket. The fees that are disclosed to the consumer during the booking process will be those fees that apply to the ticket. Because the fee schedules for critical ancillary services are effectively frozen at the time of ticket purchase\u2014which may include disclosing that fees will be higher if paid at the airport rather than at time of booking so long as that is disclosed up front\u2014 requiring transactability of critical ancillary service fees at the point of ticket purchase would provide little value, as consumers would be able to pay for critical ancillary services in the time and manner of their choosing. Through the fee disclosures required by this rule, consumers should be aware, for example, that a bag fee may be higher on the day of travel, if that is the case, so they can plan accordingly. Also, as noted in the NPRM, because consumers would not know that they will cancel or change a flight at the time of ticket purchase, there is nothing to transact for those fees at the time of purchase. As with baggage fees, increases beyond the fees that were disclosed at the time of ticket purchase are prohibited for change or cancellation fees, and so there is no consumer harm from not requiring change or cancellation fees to be transactable at the point of ticket purchase. The Department disagrees with commenters that the lack of a requirement to make critical ancillary fees transactable on ticket agent websites will drive consumers away from ticket agents. This rule maintains the status quo on the transactability of ancillary fees. A significant percentage of airline ticket sales are handled by ticket agents today, even in the absence of a regulatory requirement that ancillary fees be transactable on ticket agent websites, and ticket agents will continue to have the option under this final rule to enter into contractual agreements with carriers to sell ancillary services. (8) Data Sharing Proposal: The Department proposed to require airlines that provide fare, schedule, and availability information to ticket agents to sell or display the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers, to provide such ticket agents useable, current, and accurate information of the fee rules for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, one carry-on bag, canceling a reservation, and changing a reservation. The Department also proposed that such airlines provide family seating fee rules to ticket agents and enable these fees to be transactable by ticket agents. The intention of the proposal was for ticket agents to have access to critical ancillary service fee information sufficient to enable the ticket agents to disclose such fees to consumers. Under the proposal, carriers would not be required to distribute ancillary service fee information to any ticket agent to whom the carrier does not choose to distribute its fare, schedule, and availability information. If a carrier did not share fare information with a ticket agent, then this proposal would not require that carrier to share ancillary service fee information with that ticket agent. The proposal left open the method by which carriers could choose to distribute fee information to ticket agents. The Department did not propose to require carriers use GDSs to distribute fee information to ticket agents. Each carrier would determine for itself whether to distribute critical ancillary service fee information through GDSs as most carriers already use GDSs to distribute fare and schedule information.104 104 The Department has also discussed the airline distribution system in prior rulemakings. See, e.g., 79 FR 29970, 29975 (May 23, 2014), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2014-05-23/pdf/2014-11993.pdf and 82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-00904.pdf. Comments: Industry comments on this issue were extensive. While airlines generally agreed that the rule should not require that they use GDSs to distribute fee information to ticket agents that sell or display directly to consumers, some airlines also expressed concern regarding the proposed requirement to distribute information. Ticket agents, on the other hand, expressed the view that airlines should be required to distribute information to any entity to which the airlines distribute fare and schedule information, including GDSs. The ACPAC deliberated on the subject of data sharing, and although it did not make a recommendation on whether or how the data should be shared, the ACPAC member representing consumers commented that he did not see how ticket agents could display fees if the fee information was not provided to them.105 The ACPAC members representing airlines and airports supported the Department\u2019s proposal on not requiring airlines to share fee information with GDSs, with the member representing airlines expressing agreement with the Department\u2019s rationale to not interfere with contractual relationships.106 During deliberations, the member representing airlines commented that airline contractual relationships are the result of bargained- for , and he cautioned the committee from weighing into those relationships and giving one party veto power over the other in negotiations. The member representing airports noted that the sharing of data is the foundation for all other disclosure recommendations regarding ticket agents. The ACPAC\u2019s recommendation on data sharing was for the Department to clarify and refine what is meant by \u201cuseable, current, and accessible in real-time\u201d and \u201cnon-static dynamic fashion\u201d when describing how data is to be shared by airlines to ticket agents. In written comments, IATA, A4A, the National Airlines Council of Canada, and several other airlines supported the proposal\u2019s lack of a mandate on providing fee information to GDSs. IATA also commented that airlines should not be required to share data with metasearch 105 See Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee - January 12, 2023, Meeting Minutes, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0111. 106 No recommendations were made on this specific question, as two of the four ACPAC members were prepared to abstain from voting on this issue. companies that are not authorized agents of the airline. IATA noted two available options for establishing agent-airline connections sufficient to present dynamic bag fee information: direct connect, where the agent or agency enters into a direct connection with an airline, or IATA\u2019s New Distribution Capability (NDC), essentially an XML-based technical standard for use in airline distribution where an airline shares its NDC application programming interface with the ticket agent or the agent\u2019s technology provider. On NDC, American Airlines added that NDC provides more information and better customization than GDSs. IATA stated that some online ticket agents contract directly with ATPCO for fee information rather than relying on GDSs. IATA expressed concern about the capabilities of GDSs, stating that GDSs would need to divert IT resources away from improving the passenger booking experience to instead deliver ancillary fee information. It noted that GDSs had trouble implementing the requirements of the 2011 final rule, due to its outdated system EDIFACT, and that GDSs have not met their commitments to support the NDC. IATA also stated that a requirement to use GDSs would give the three major GDS companies the ability to extract exorbitant fees from airlines and artificially extend the use of an outdated network. A4A added its view that GDSs generally resist carrier innovation in product offerings, and American Airlines agreed that GDSs lack technological capabilities. Some individual airlines and an individual commenter opposed any requirement to distribute ancillary fee information to ticket agents. Air Canada stated that the rule would force carriers to manage GDSs and how their information would be displayed on other channels, and the individual commenter asserted that airlines would be put in the position of being called to task for problems caused and errors made by third parties. Frontier Airlines stated that it uses proprietary technology and algorithms incompatible with GDSs, and any requirement that it provide data to ticket agents would require rebuilding the airline\u2019s distribution capabilities. Southwest Airlines stated that it does not generally contract with ticket agents and that the decision on whether to contract with a ticket agent should be left to the airline. The individual commenter also stated that the proposal was contrary to the Airline Deregulation Act by forcing airlines to conduct business with OTAs and GDSs, even though the carrier\u2019s own business plan and IT system may be designed only for direct sales to the customer. Ticket agents, including GDSs, generally asserted that the rule should require airlines to distribute fee information to GDSs. Travel Tech, for example, stated that the rule should include GDSs as ticket agents, and it added that it would support requiring fee information to be provided to all intermediaries to which an airline provides fares for distribution, including ATPCO and GDSs. Travel Tech noted that airlines already provide fare data to GDSs, and it disagreed with airlines\u2019 expressed concern that GDSs were wedded to old technology and will abuse market power. According to Travel Tech, the requirement to display passenger-specific baggage fees is infeasible for ticket agents, and not requiring the use of GDSs will add to development time and costs. Travel Tech and others noted that significant resources would be required for travel agencies to negotiate separately with each airline, with Travelport noting that this may cause agencies to shut down. Travel Tech added that GDSs are the only entities capable of distributing ancillary fee data in the short-term. The organization asserted that NDC is not an adequate replacement for GDSs. Amadeus expressed disagreement with IATA\u2019s assertion that its technology was outdated or that GDSs would need to divert resources away from making technological improvements to meet the requirements in the rule. Amadeus added that requiring that airlines share data with GDSs would not delay implementation of the NDC, and that the NDC and EDIFACT would need to coexist for some time, with NDC still in its infancy. Other ticket agent associations and individual ticket agents, such as ASTA and Hopper, as well as GDSs, agreed with the viewpoint that airlines should be required to distribute fee information to GDSs. Metasearch entities supported the objective of having access to airline fee information, but they noted several concerns. Skyscanner stated that it supported the sharing of ancillary fee information with metasearch entities, noting that the requirement would address a longstanding lack of fee disclosure by airlines and ensure that metasearch sites can display fee information. Skyscanner also stated that it depends on direct connect arrangements and ATPCO and GDSs as the primary source of its data, and that the information sharing requirements should be extended to include those latter entities. Google agreed that fee information should be provided to all intermediaries and distribution channels that may be relied upon by consumer-facing entities. Skyscanner also urged the Department not to permit airlines to impose restrictions on the way their fee information is used by the recipients of the information. Several commenters expressed viewpoints on the  \u201cuseable, current, and accessible in real-time\u201d and \u201cnon-static, dynamic fashion,\u201d as referenced in the NPRM. Travel Tech expressed agreement with the ACPAC recommendation to clarify the meaning of these , and it believed that these changes should not require expensive or costly manipulation for the display of fees. Travel Tech also expressed the view that airlines should be encouraged to work toward data uniformity or standardization, with Travelport adding that airlines can more efficiently bear the cost of standardizing their own data rather than individual ticket agents. Sabre stated that airlines should be made to distribute ancillary fee information in a standardized machine-readable format across all channels they already use to distribute fares, including GDSs. USTOA expressed concern that  like \u201cuseable\u201d would be susceptible to differing interpretations, and it agreed that a lack of industry standards for furnishing information to ticket agents would impose increased compliance costs and practical burdens. Skyscanner stated that fee data is not \u201cuseable\u201d if it requires costly processing or other manipulation before it can be displayed. Multiple commenters, including Travel Tech, Bookings Holdings, and Skyscanner, expressed concern about being held responsible for inaccurate or incomplete fee data provided by airlines. Travel Tech noted, for example, that ticket agents should not be responsible for failing to display information not provided by airlines and should not be barred from providing flight information because airlines have not provided accurate fee data. Skyscanner urged the Department to clarify that metasearch sites and other entities will not be held responsible if airlines fail to provide covered fee information, which would prevent these entities from displaying the information to consumers, and it also believes that it should be allowed to display fare, schedule, and availability information even if it has not received accompanying ancillary fee information from the airline. DOT Response: After carefully considering the comments on this issue, the Department is requiring airlines to share critical ancillary fee information with any entity that is required by law to disclose critical ancillary service fee and policy information directly to consumers.107 The Department agrees with commenters, including members of the ACPAC, regarding the need for airlines to share fee information with ticket agents for those ticket agents to make the required fee disclosures. In the Department\u2019s view, the requirement for fee data sharing is necessary to enable ticket agents to disclose fees to consumers when providing fare and schedule information. The Department provides its analysis of how the failure to share critical ancillary fee information is an unfair practice in section D (1)(d). In this final rule, as discussed in section E (1), the Department is requiring ticket agents to disclose critical ancillary service fees and policies to consumers. The Department is excluding corporate travel agents from these requirements and deferring to another rulemaking its determination on whether metasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents that must disclose ancillary fee information required. Accordingly, this final rule does not require airlines to share critical ancillary service fees with corporate travel agents. It also does not require sharing of information with metasearch entities unless and until metasearch entities are required to disclose that information to consumers. Despite the absence of a regulatory requirement, the Department recognizes that it benefits consumers, metasearch sites, and airlines if all critical ancillary fee information is available through all sources that consumers use to shop for air transportation. As a result, the Department encourages airlines and metasearch sites to 107 As noted in sections E (3)(c) and E (7), the Department has decided not to move forward with its data sharing and transactability proposals related to family seating fees at this time. enter into voluntary agreements to share critical ancillary fee information while further regulatory action is under consideration. The Department continues to hold the view that it is not appropriate to require carriers to use GDSs to distribute fee information to ticket agents. The Department\u2019s interest is in ensuring that ticket agents disclose critical ancillary service fees to consumers whenever fare and schedule information is provided. Whether carriers share the required data through GDSs or by direct connect or by NDC are business decisions, and the Department seeks to minimize government interference with the business relationships between airlines, GDSs, and others. The Department notes that changes appear to be ongoing in the marketplace for information distribution, including the adoption and use of NDC. Further, the comments illustrate that there continue to be disagreements between airlines and GDSs on whether GDSs have the modern technology airlines need to merchandise and sell their products the way the airlines choose. The Department is unwilling to impose a prescriptive requirement on this issue while the situation is evolving and while the dynamic between airlines and GDSs remains highly complex. We believe that these airline-GDS relationships are best left to the marketplace. Nothing in this rule precludes or requires airlines to use GDSs to distribute critical ancillary fee information to consumer-facing ticket agents. As noted in the NPRM, GDSs may provide the lowest cost and most efficient way of distributing this information to ticket agents that sell the carrier\u2019s ancillary services. This may lead airlines to conclude that they need or want to use GDSs to distribute fee information to meet the implementation deadlines imposed by this rule. The Department notes that these circumstances may change in the future and an overly prescriptive requirement may become too rigid and may ultimately hurt, rather than improve, the consumer experience. Also, the Department is adopting its proposal requiring the sharing of critical ancillary fee information only with the entities that a carrier chooses to distribute its fare, schedule, and availability information. Under this final rule, airlines are required to share critical ancillary fee information only with those entities with whom they provide fare, schedule, and availability information and who are required to disclose this information directly to consumers. Airlines are not required to share ancillary service fee information with entities with whom they have no existing relationship for sharing airline schedule and fare information. On the  \u201ccurrent, useable, and accessible in real-time\u201d (or \u201cuseable, current, and accurate,\u201d as this phrase appears in this final rule) and \u201cdynamic, non-static fashion,\u201d the Department does not define these  in the regulation. The Department recognizes commenters\u2019 concerns about the lack of standardization in the data sharing process; however, as with other aspects of the data sharing requirement in the regulation, the Department believes that the requirement is better suited to a performance-based, rather than prescriptive, standard. A more performance-based framework could enable the marketplace to coalesce around several functioning models of data transfer that will work to meet the regulation\u2019s objectives\u2014namely, for ticket agents to have access to ancillary fee information sufficient to meet the fee disclosure requirements under this rule. We do note that, to meet the fee disclosure requirements of this final rule, ticket agents would need to be able to access fee rules and/or specific fee information such that each consumer itinerary search will result in the provision of accurate and applicable critical ancillary fee information that this rule requires. The Department expects that this will mean automated data transfers rather than manual. We also note that the requirement is for airlines to provide information \u201csufficient to ensure compliance by such entities\u201d with the disclosure requirement. If airlines transfer the data in a way that is generally inaccessible to ticket agents despite reasonable efforts by the ticket agents to incorporate the data into their systems, then the information provided by the airlines is not considered sufficient. We expect both airlines and ticket agents to work in good faith to ensure that the data is useable to the recipient. Understanding that smaller ticket agents may require additional time to modify their systems to receive data and to disclose fee information in accordance with the regulation, this rule provides for additional time for small ticket agents to come into compliance. See section F. The Department has considered ticket agents\u2019 concern that they could be held liable for missing or inaccurate data provided by the airlines. After considering these comments, the Department has determined that this concern is best addressed through OACP\u2019s investigatory process since OACP would be able to determine whether ticket agents\u2019 failure to properly disclose fees is a result of receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from an airline, based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. The disclosures required by this rulemaking apply to both airlines and ticket agents. Under the regulation, if OACP were to investigate and find that missing or erroneous fee information displayed on a ticket agent\u2019s website was entirely the result of airline action or inaction, then OACP would pursue action against the airline and not the ticket agent. This rule affords airlines flexibility on how fee information is transmitted to ticket agents (i.e., whether the airline decides to use direct connect, GDS, or another method of delivery) but also requires airlines to ensure that information is accurately, timely, and effectively transmitted. (9) Remedies for Noncompliance Proposal: The Department proposed to treat as an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712: (1) the failure by a carrier or ticket agent to provide the critical ancillary fee disclosures required by the proposed rule, and (2) the collection of a fee for critical ancillary services if that fee was not disclosed when fare and schedule information was provided. In addition, the Department proposed to require a seller of air transportation to refund any fee charged for a critical ancillary service if the fee was not disclosed at the time the consumer searched for and purchased air transportation. Comments: The Department received only a few comments directly addressing these proposed provisions, all from industry commenters who opposed the requirement for a ticket agent to refund fees charged by an airline. USTOA stated that the proposed requirement for ticket agents to provide refunds for services actually provided, in contrast to refunds for services not provided, exceeds the Department\u2019s statutory authority. This comment asserted that the Department is authorized to issue civil penalties for violations of 49 U.S.C. 41712, but not equitable relief like disgorgement, and the comment urged the Department to rely on investigations and civil penalties to incentivize compliance. USTOA also raised concerns about the burdens of retaining information to demonstrate what critical ancillary fee information was provided to the consumer at the time of search. Similarly, ASTA raised concerns with the purported challenges of demonstrating what was disclosed by the ticket agent to a consumer in an offline transaction and the burden of providing refunds for funds collected by the airline, not the ticket agent. Finally, Google stated that an entity that displays and relies on ancillary fee information provided by an airline should not be liable for a later overcharge by the airline and expressed concern that the proposal was likely to impose \u201ca severe financial burden on ticket agents.\u201d Google added that metasearch entities would need to collect and retain personal information for purposes of issuing a refund and would not be able to validate data provided by a consumer, such as frequent flier status, that may result in an airline charging a higher fee than was originally displayed.108 DOT Response: After carefully considering the comments, the Department is maintaining its proposal to treat as an unfair and deceptive practice the failure by a carrier or ticket agent to provide and adhere to the critical ancillary fee disclosures required by this rule but is not moving forward with its proposal to require a seller of air transportation to refund a fee for any critical ancillary service charged if the fee was not disclosed at the time the consumer searched for and purchased air transportation. While the Department disagrees with USTOA\u2019s comment that the proposed remedy exceeds DOT\u2019s authority, the Department has determined that any violations of the disclosure requirements can be adequately addressed through its existing enforcement process, which can be initiated by a consumer\u2019s filing of a complaint through OACP\u2019s website. The Department notes that, as an enforcement policy, OACP ensures that the violating entity has corrected the problematic issue and made whole any consumer that was negatively impacted. 108 Google noted that the proposed rule\u2019s preamble stated that the refund would be owed by the \u201cseller of air transportation,\u201d but the draft regulatory text did not use this term and instead referred to a refund by a \u201cticket agent,\u201d which the Department has previously asserted includes metasearch entities. This includes the Department seeking monetary relief for consumers in negotiated settlement agreements addressing violations of 49 U.S.C. 41712, where appropriate. The Department has obtained monetary relief for consumers in previous enforcement matters in addition to assessing civil monetary penalties. See 49 U.S.C. 46301. (10) Other Proposals (a) Air Tour Packages Proposal: The Department proposed that the fee disclosures for a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and a second checked bag under the NPRM would not apply to air-tour packages advertised or sold online by ticket agents if the air transportation component is not finalized and the carrier providing air transportation is not known at the time of booking. Instead, the Department proposed to require ticket agents in such situations to disclose that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other information specific to the consumer. The Department further proposed that, once the identity of the carrier providing the air transportation becomes known, the ticket agent must provide passenger-specific fee information for a first checked, second checked, and carry-on bag to prospective passengers and those passengers who booked the air-tour package before the identity of the carrier was known. The Department requested comment on whether this exception for certain air tour packages adequately addresses concerns of air-tour package sellers and whether such an exception adequately protects consumers. Comments: American Airlines opposed the Department\u2019s proposal to require sellers of air tour packages to state \u201cbaggage fees may apply\u201d if the carrier is unknown at the time of booking. Asserting that the Department is essentially exempting air tour package sellers from the requirement to disclose baggage fees, American recommended that sellers of air tour packages instead be required to provide a range of baggage fees when a carrier\u2019s identity is unknown. American Airlines argued that the Department\u2019s proposal would expand a technology gap to the detriment of consumers, adding that \u201cpackagers are capable of providing reasonable estimates or ranges for potential expenses for travelers. These requirements would increase transparency and cost certainty for travelers.\u201d USTOA supported the Department\u2019s proposal but noted that the NPRM did not specify the timeframe within which a ticket agent must provide the required baggage fee disclosures to consumers after the identity of the air carrier becomes known. DOT Response: The Department disagrees with American Airlines\u2019 assertion that the Department is exempting air tour package sellers from baggage fee disclosure requirements. The Department is adopting the proposal requiring that air tour package sellers provide the relevant fee information once the identity of the carrier is known. The rule does not require that air tour package sellers disclose specific bag fees at the time of sale when the identity of the airline is not known, as identifying specific bag fees without knowing the operating airline could lead to guessing and inaccurate information, thereby confusing consumers. The Department has long required carriers and ticket agents to provide specific fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage, even under existing regulations that permit other ancillary fees to be expressed as a range. Baggage fees across carriers vary significantly and so requiring air tour package sellers to provide a range of baggage fees, as American Airlines recommends, would not assist consumers to assess the costs of transportation as the range of baggage fees for multiple carriers would be so wide as to render the information useless. Under this final rule, if the airline for an air-tour package is unknown when a passenger books the package, then the ticket agent must disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner at the time that the ticket agent first offers a package fare quotation that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced based on the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer information. In addition, in response to the comment from USTOA, this final rule clarifies that, once the identity of the airline for a tour package is known, the ticket agent must provide the baggage fee disclosures otherwise required by this final rule at the same time that the ticket agent discloses the name of the carrier to the passenger. The failure to disclose that additional baggage fees may apply when a passenger books an air tour package without an identifiable carrier and the failure to disclose the passenger-specific fees for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag when the carrier is known is unfair because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. This practice is likely to cause substantial injury because of the additional funds spent to transport bags that might have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up front. This harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers likely will not know that the bag fees are not included without the disclosure that there may be additional bag fees. Also, consumers would not know the cost of the bag fee without the ticket agent sharing that information with the passenger when the carrier is identified. Further, the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition as the disclosures would ensure consumers are making informed decisions and would enhance competition. It is also deceptive to fail to disclose that bag fees may apply when the carrier is not known and to fail to disclose the passenger-specific fees when the carrier is known. Without these disclosures, a reasonable consumer is likely to be misled to believe that baggage fees were included in the price and also misled about the total purchase price. This matter is material as it impacts consumers\u2019 funds. Air tour package sellers should provide consumers the opportunity to modify their air tour package at no cost or to cancel their air tour package for a refund, if the consumer chooses, once the applicable bag fees are disclosed to the consumer. (b) 24-Hour Rule Disclosure Proposal: The Department proposed to require carriers and ticket agents with websites marketed to U.S. consumers to display on the last page of the booking process a brief statement on whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer\u2019s booking to be cancelled without penalty within 24 hours, or whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer to hold the reservation without payment for 24 hours, provided that the reservation was made at least one week before the flight\u2019s departure. Carriers are already required to either permit consumers to cancel their tickets within 24 hours without penalty or hold their reservations at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment if the reservation is made more than a week before the flight\u2019s departure. Similar requirements currently do not exist for ticket agents though agents may do so voluntarily. This proposal is that the carrier\u2019s and ticket agent\u2019s chosen policy be disclosed on the last page of the booking process, which is distinct from the existing requirement that the carrier\u2019s chosen policy (i.e., 24-hour hold or cancel within 24 hours with no penalty) be disclosed in that carrier\u2019s customer service plan pursuant to 14 CFR 259.5. Comments: The Department received few comments on this issue and those comments either supported the Department\u2019s proposal or were neutral. For example, IdeaWorks, a consulting firm, agreed that \u201c[a]wareness of this benefit should be reinforced.\u201d In addition, IATA noted that it had no objection to the requirement for carriers to display the 24-hour cancellation policy on their websites, while USTOA stated that it did not object to the new requirement provided that the final rule was clear that ticket agents are not required to allow passengers to cancel a booking within 24 hours or to hold the ticket for 24 hours at the quoted price. DOT Response: The Department adopts this proposal with three clarifying edits. As proposed, this final rule requires carriers to disclose on the last page of the booking process whether the consumer\u2019s booking can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase without penalty or whether it can be held at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment. The Department clarifies that this disclosure must be made only if the reservation is made at least one week before the flight\u2019s departure, consistent with the existing regulatory requirement for carriers in 14 CFR 259.5(b)(4). Ticket agents are required to provide the same disclosure of their policy on allowing a passenger to hold a reservation for 24 hours or cancel a reservation within 24 hours without a penalty, for flights departing one week or more after the reservation. Ticket agents that do not offer either the 24-hour free cancellation or 24-hour reservation hold options without charge must disclose before ticket purchase that the consumer will not be able to cancel his or her booking after it is executed, consistent with this rule. The Department has an open rulemaking that would address, among other things, requiring travel agents to adopt minimum customer standards such as the 24-hour rule similar to those imposed on carriers.109 The Department clarifies in this rule that airlines and ticket agents must make the required disclosure in a clear and conspicuous manner. In addition, the Department is amending the requirement for carriers to include an assurance in their customer service plan that they will offer either a 24-hour free cancellation or 24-hour reservation hold option at no cost to also include an assurance to disclose their chosen 24-hour policy on the last page of the booking process before ticket purchase as required in this rule. The Department has determined that the failure to make the required disclosure before ticket purchase is an unfair and deceptive practice, as discussed in section D (1)(b). (c) E-Ticket Confirmations Proposal: Section 399.85(c) currently requires air carriers and ticket agents to include information regarding the passenger\u2019s free baggage allowance and the specific fee information for first and second checked bags and a carry-on item on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation, taking into account factors such as frequent flyer status that affect those charges. This regulation currently provides that carriers must provide this information in text form on the e-ticket confirmation. Agents may provide this information either in text form on the e-ticket confirmations or through a hyperlink to the specific location on an airline website or their own website where this information is displayed. In the NPRM, the Department requested comment on whether there is a benefit in retaining these requirements. 109 Information on the rulemaking titled \u201cAir Transportation Consumer Protection Requirements for Ticket Agents\u201d (RIN 2015-AE57) is available in the Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Action at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE57. Comments: Few commenters addressed this issue. A4A urged DOT to remove the e- ticket disclosure because, in its view, existing disclosures are \u201credundant, unnecessary, and burdensome\u201d and because consumers would have already received the information required in the e-ticket confirmation during the search process.110 On the other hand, AARP called the e- ticket confirmation \u201can essential element of consumer protection.\u201d AARP further noted that \u201cthe dates of travel may be weeks or months after the tickets were booked, and many consumers will have forgotten the specific fee amounts presented to them at the time of booking,\u201d making the e- ticket confirmation \u201can important record for consumers to have at the time of travel.\u201d FlyersRights asked the Department to require additional disclosure after ticket purchase of the size limitations for personal items, carry-on bags, checked bags, instruments, and sporting equipment. DOT Response: The Department maintains in this final rule, with modifications, the requirements that carriers and ticket agents must include specific fee information for first and second checked bags and a carry-on item on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation and that the fee information provided must take into account the passenger-specific factors that affect those charges. The Department agrees with AARP that the e-ticket confirmation serves as a valuable record for consumers concerning the fee information provided at the time of booking and disagrees with A4A that listing this information on the e-ticket is redundant or burdensome. To ensure that the e-ticket provides an accurate record of the fees disclosed to consumers at the time of purchase, the Department is removing the allowance for ticket agents to provide a link to baggage fees as an alternative to providing the information in text form. 110 In its comment, A4A also asked DOT to eliminate the existing requirement at 14 CFR 399.85(b) that U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, agents of either, and ticket agents provide a prominent disclosure that \u201cadditional bag fees may apply\u201d and where consumers can see these baggage fees. The Department proposed to replace that existing requirement with the requirement to disclose itinerary-specific or passenger-specific fees, depending upon the consumer\u2019s search type, for a first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag. The final rule removes the existing requirement as proposed. Requirements for the display of baggage fees under this final rule are discussed in section E (4). The Department has determined that it is an unfair practice to provide links to bag fees in the e-ticket confirmation instead of providing the information in text form. Links to bag fees that lead to complex charts are confusing to consumers and may ultimately not be instructive for many consumers in determining the bag fee that would apply to them. Further, the lack of an e- ticket confirmation with the bag fee in text form is likely to cause substantial injury for consumers who are charged a bag fee that is higher than the one disclosed during the search process because consumers would lack a valuable record to demonstrate the fee information provided at the time of booking. This harm is not reasonably avoidable because consumers are not able to generate the confirmation on their own. Also, the harm that these consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because lack of clarity about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, consumers, and competition. As such, the Department is imposing in this final rule the same requirement for ticket agents to display baggage fees in text form on the e-ticket confirmation that has traditionally applied to carriers. In response to the comment from FlyersRights, the Department also clarifies that the information about the passenger\u2019s free baggage allowance currently required to be included in the e-ticket confirmation must include information about a personal item. This is not a substantive change to existing requirements. (d) Bag Policy Change Disclosures Proposal: The existing regulation at 14 CFR 399.85(a) requires carriers to disclose any increase in applicable fees for carry-on or first or second checked bags promptly and prominently, along with any change in baggage allowances, on the homepages of their websites for at least three months after the change becomes effective. In the NPRM, the Department proposed language changes to clarify the scope of websites covered by this existing requirement but did not propose substantive changes. DOT also requested comment on whether these requirements would still be useful to consumers if the NPRM was finalized. Comments: The Department received few comments on this issue. One individual stated that additional guidance on how airlines should communicate baggage fee increases to consumers is needed. A4A urged the Department to remove this required disclosure because it would be redundant and unnecessary if the rule were adopted as proposed. DOT Response: The Department agrees with A4A that the existing requirement to disclose baggage fee increases and changes in baggage allowances on the carrier\u2019s homepage is no longer necessary. Under this final rule, airlines and ticket agents must provide the consumer with passenger-specific or itinerary-specific fees, depending on the consumer\u2019s search type, for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag when a fare and itinerary is displayed in response to a consumer\u2019s search. As discussed in section E (10)(e), under 14 CFR 399.88, these fees may not increase from what was displayed to the consumer before ticket purchase. Applicable baggage fees must also be memorialized on the e-ticket confirmation. Accordingly, prominent disclosure of baggage fee increases on carriers\u2019 websites would be unnecessary under this final rule because carriers may not apply such increases to ticketed passengers.111 (e) Post Purchase Price Increases Proposal: The Department proposed to amend 14 CFR 399.88, which prohibits sellers of air transportation from increasing the price for air transportation including the price for ancillary services that have not yet been purchased after a ticket is purchased, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee or if the potential for an increase was disclosed as required prior to purchase. Although the existing regulation includes a broad prohibition on increases to all ancillary service fees, regardless of whether these items are purchased along with the air transportation, in 2011, the Department announced that with respect to fees for ancillary 111 In response to the individual commenter, the Department notes that the post-purchase price increase prohibition at 14 CFR 399.88 does not prohibit an airline from charging different fees for a first-checked, second-checked, or carry-on bag based on when the passenger pays the baggage fee (e.g., in advance or at the airport), but that it instead prohibits airlines from changing baggage fee rules that apply when a ticket is purchased. services that were not purchased with the air transportation, it would only enforce the prohibition on post-purchase price increases for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags.112 The application of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was also at issue in a lawsuit filed by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the Department\u2019s 2011 guidance and upheld the Department\u2019s rule prohibiting post purchase price increases as it is currently being applied.113 The proposed revisions were intended to make the regulatory text consistent with the Department\u2019s rule as applied under the Department\u2019s 2011 guidance and upheld by the Court. The Department did not propose changes to the rule as it is applied but sought comment on whether it should require that the price for ancillary services not purchased with the ticket be frozen beyond first and second checked bag and a carry-on item. More specifically, the Department asked whether prohibition on post purchase price increase should extend to fees for all baggage (including fees for oversized or overweight bags) or all ancillary services that have been identified as being critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. Comments: IATA and American Airlines opposed any expansion of the post-purchase price increase beyond the fees for first checked bag, second checked bag, and carry-on bag. Citing seat fees as one example, American Airlines stated that many ancillary fees are dynamically priced, and so prohibiting post-purchase increase of those fees \u201cwould have the unintended consequence of foreclosing discounts for early purchases and likely result in increased prices.\u201d AARP and FlyersRights commented on this proposal on behalf of consumers. AARP stated that the prohibition should apply to \u201cthe ancillary fees covered by this rule\u201d and added that allowing fees to increase at a later date would undermine the regulatory goal of enabling 112 See Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket (December 28, 2011). 113 Spirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20\u201321. Petition for Writ of Certiorari denied on Apr. 1, 2013. consumers to make informed purchasing decisions based on the full cost of travel. FlyersRights advocated for extending the post-purchase price increase prohibition to all ancillary fees, not only those critical ancillary fees required to be displayed by this rule. This commenter stated that fees advertised at the time of ticket sale should not be increased once a consumer is locked into a ticket purchase. DOT Response: The final rule extends the post-purchase price increase prohibition to all fees for critical ancillary services. The Department notes that, in addition to the post-purchase price increase prohibition on fees for first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage, as currently applied and discussed above, change and cancellation fees may not be increased beyond what was disclosed to the consumer at the time of purchase under 14 CFR 253.7. Because the only critical ancillary services identified in this final rule are first checked, second checked, and carry-on baggage and ticket changes and cancellations, the modification from the proposal to cover all critical ancillary service fees does not impose any new burdens on carriers or ticket agents. If the Department identifies additional critical ancillary services, after notice and opportunity for comment, then the post-purchase price increase prohibition will apply to those services at that time. The Department declines to extend the prohibition to additional ancillary fees not critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision at this time due to the complexity and dynamic nature of many ancillary services. For example, as noted by the airlines, some airlines offer dynamic seat fee pricing that may adjust based on demand and availability, and consumers relying on a specific seat fee may be confused if the seat associated with that fee is no longer available by the time the consumer is ready to purchase a seat assignment. As another example, freezing the price of inflight food offerings at the time of ticket purchase could cause different passengers to have different pricing regarding the same food product purchased at the same time, a situation which could cause consumer confusion and be difficult for airlines to manage. (f) Full Fare Rule and Percentage Off Discounts Proposal: The Department proposed non-substantive changes to the current \u201cfull fare\u201d requirement in 14 CFR 399.84(a) that when a carrier or ticket agent quotes a price in advertising or a solicitation, the price must be the total fare, inclusive of taxes and fees. The proposed changes consisted of minor changes to \u00a7 399.84(a) to promote readability and accommodate the ancillary fee disclosures proposed in the NPRM. Specifically, the Department proposed that, if a consumer wishes to view ancillary service fees, such as bag fees, incorporated into the total quoted price during an itinerary search, carriers and ticket agents may display the total price of the transportation, inclusive of mandatory taxes and fees and the consumer\u2019s selected ancillary service fees, more prominently than a price that includes only all mandatory charges. These adjustments were not intended to make substantive changes to the full fare rule. Under the existing full fare rule, carriers and ticket agents may state separately any charges included within the single total price on their websites, but such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed more prominently than the total price, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per-passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge. Consistent with this requirement, the Department explained that advertisements that state discounts in the form of percentage-off sales must refer to a discount off the total price to be paid by the consumer for the ticket, unless the airline or ticket agent explicitly states that the discount is based on only a portion of the fare. For example, an advertisement that indicates air transportation is on sale for a percentage off but does not apply the discount to the total price would be misleading if it did not specify that it is a percentage off only the \u201cbase fare\u201d or other fare component. The Department further elaborated that, when the  \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare\u201d are used in an advertisement stating a percentage off (e.g., \u201ca 25% discount off the flight\u201d), a reasonable consumer would understand that the percentage off applies to the total price of the transportation. In the NPRM, the Department explained that there is a lack of clarity about the meaning of the term \u201cbase fare\u201d and offering a percentage discount off of the \u201cbase fare\u201d may be misleading if the discount only applies to a portion of the carrier-imposed charges, and not the total amount of carrier-imposed charges (i.e., the fare for the transportation plus carrier-imposed charges such as fuel surcharges and other mandatory carrier fees). The Department solicited comment on whether and how to address this issue in the final rule. Comments: Several commenters representing both industry and consumers asked the Department to define \u201cbase fare\u201d to mean all mandatory carrier-imposed charges and agreed with the Department\u2019s assessment in the NPRM that providing a \u201cbase fare\u201d discount would be misleading if the base fare did not include all such mandatory charges. For example, Southwest Airlines stated that some airlines advertise \u201cgenerous eye-catching percentage-off discounts that can be fairly described as \u2018bait-and-switch\u2019 tactics\u201d of a large percentage off a low \u201cbase fare\u201d that does not include all mandatory carrier-imposed fees. Southwest explained that in such circumstances mandatory carrier-imposed fees \u201coften make up the majority of the ticket price\u201d and are not discounted. In addition, both Travelers United and Southwest Airlines requested that DOT clarify that the \u201cbase fare\u201d must include all mandatory airline-imposed fees on the distribution channel where a fare is viewed (e.g., if there is a charge for online booking and the consumer is searching for airfare online, then the online booking fee must be included in the base fare). A small travel agent asked the Department to go further and prohibit all fuel surcharges and carrier-imposed fees, stating that fares are filed to ATPCO with the base fare only, making it difficult to compare fares between carriers. On the other hand, IATA opposed any additional regulation in this area, stating that consumers understand that percentage-off discount offers do not discount carrier surcharges. Regarding the existing full fare rule, a joint comment from multiple State attorneys general noted that airlines often charge fees in connection with different methods of booking, including online, telephone, or in-person booking fees. These commenters noted that they understand that the existing full fare rule already requires such fees to be included in the full fare, but asked DOT to cover such fees in this rulemaking in the event that this understanding was incorrect. DOT Response: In this final rule, the Department is permitting airlines and ticket agents to disclose a total price inclusive of mandatory taxes and fees and ancillary fees in place of or more prominently than a total price that only includes all mandatory taxes and fees. In response to comments, the Department is adding a new paragraph (e) to \u00a7 399.84, which provides that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to offer a percentage-off discount for air transportation, a tour, or a tour component that does not make clear at the outset the  and  of the offer, including how the discount is calculated. This new provision further provides that, when used in any advertising or solicitation, the term \u201cbase fare\u201d must refer to the amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed charges. The Department agrees with commenters that an advertisement of a percentage-off discount that is unclear about its  or is offered as a percentage off a \u201cbase fare\u201d that does not include all mandatory carrier-imposed charges is unfair and deceptive to consumers. The Department is unpersuaded by IATA\u2019s unsupported statement that consumers understand that base fare discounts do not include discounts off carrier-imposed surcharges, particularly as to those consumers who purchase air transportation infrequently. The Department notes that carriers and ticket agents may continue to list the components of the \u201cbase fare\u201d separately, consistent with \u00a7 399.84(a). Also, as requested in a joint comment from multiple State attorneys general, the Department is making clear that mandatory booking charges are required to be included in the quoted fare under the full fare rule. Southwest Airlines and Traveler\u2019s United also requested confirmation that if there is a charge for online booking and the consumer is searching for airfare online, then the online booking fee must be included in the base fare. That is correct. As the Department explained when it issued its final rule that addresses full fare advertising in 2011, while a carrier or ticket agent generally is not required to include a booking fee in its advertised fare if there are other means for the passenger to obtain the air transportation (e.g., a booking fee only applies for tickets that are purchased over the telephone), where airfares are advertised via an Internet site that permits consumers to purchase fares, the fares advertised on the site must include all charges required to make the purchase on the site. For example, it would be unfair and deceptive to hold out on such an Internet site a fare that can be purchased only at airport ticket counters but that excludes a convenience fee that is applied to Internet sales.114 To avoid confusion in this area, the Department is adding this clarification to its full fare rule. (g) Codeshare Flights Proposal: The Department did not propose any new requirements specific to codeshare flights, separate from the general proposal that airlines and ticket agents disclose critical ancillary fees on an itinerary-specific basis. Comments: A comment from multiple State attorneys general stated that \u201cwhere there is a codeshare arrangement in place, the consumer must be notified of the fees that will actually be charged, whether they are imposed by the airline through which the consumer booked the flight or the airline operating the flight.\u201d Though this comment noted that the issue appeared to be addressed by the requirement that the fees provided be accurate, these commenters asked DOT to consider whether special requirements were necessary for codeshare flights. Two individual commenters similarly stated that carriers should be required to disclose the fees of their partners. DOT Response: The Department has determined that no revisions to the proposed rule are necessary to address these comments. The Department proposed, and this final rule requires, that airlines and ticket agents disclose critical ancillary fees on an itinerary-specific basis. This includes the requirement in \u00a7399.85(c) of this rule for a carrier to accurately display itinerary- specific fees, including those involving flights operated by a partner carrier. In addition, this final rule maintains the existing regulatory requirement in \u00a7399.85(e) (recodified in this rule at \u00a7399.85(i)) that airlines must disclose through their websites any differences between their 114 76 FR 23110, 23143 (Apr. 25, 2011). optional services and related fees and those of a carrier operating the flight under a codeshare arrangement. This existing requirement includes the fees for ancillary services that are not covered by the requirements of this final rule. This final rule also maintains the existing regulatory requirement in 14 CFR 399.87 that, for passengers whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees that apply at the beginning of a passenger\u2019s itinerary throughout his or her entire itinerary. That section also specifies that, in the case of code-share flights that form part of an itinerary whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a U.S. point, U.S. and foreign carriers must apply the baggage allowances and fees of the marketing carrier throughout the itinerary to the extent that they differ from those of any operating carrier. (h) Additional Comments The Department received several comments that did not specifically address the proposals in the NPRM. Comment: Google noted that the NPRM did not address how the proposed requirements would affect existing requirements at 14 CFR part 256 governing how ticket agents and air carriers must respond to consumer searches and disclose display bias. Specifically, Google asked whether fees for baggage, ticket changes and cancellations, and seat assignments should be included in the total price when ranking responses based on the lowest total price. DOT Response: The Department\u2019s existing regulation at 14 CFR 256.4 prohibits undisclosed display bias and requires each electronic airline information system to \u201cdisplay information in an objective manner based on search criteria selected by the user;\u201d the regulation provides \u201clowest total cost\u201d as one example of search criterion. This regulation further requires that those flight options best satisfying the user\u2019s selected search criteria \u201cmust be ranked in lists above other flight options,\u201d but provides that this \u201cdoes not preclude systems from setting default display parameters that are not deceptive or offering users the option to choose a variety of display methods within those parameters.\u201d The Department clarifies that this final rule does not alter the existing requirements in part 256. If an airline or ticket agent\u2019s site enables a consumer to select desired ancillary services (e.g., baggage) to be included in the total quoted price for search results and the consumer requests to receive search results by \u201clowest total cost,\u201d then any ancillary fees selected by the passenger should be included in the total price for purposes of ranking flight options to reflect the consumer\u2019s selected search parameters. Comments: FlyersRights and multiple State attorneys general stated that states should be provided with statutory authority to regulate aviation consumer protection. DOT Response: This issue is outside the Department\u2019s authority and cannot be addressed by the Department in this final rule. The Department works with state authorities on aviation consumer protection issues where appropriate and within the confines of existing statutory authority.115 Comment: The U.S. PIRG Education Fund asked the Department to update its method of reporting consumer complaints, suggesting models currently used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). DOT Response: The Department has been examining how best to review, process, and report air travel service consumer complaints, which has included looking at various models including models currently used by NHTSA and CFPB. The Department anticipates that its new modernized system will be operational in 2024 and will be further enhanced with funding from the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) in the coming years. Comments: A few individual commenters asked the Department to impose a comprehensive passengers\u2019 bill of rights. 115 On April 16, 2024, the Department announced a new partnership with State attorneys general to prioritize misconduct cases referred to DOT by State attorneys general who uncover unfair or deceptive airline practices. See https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-buttigieg-launches-bipartisan-partnership-state-attorneys- general-protect. DOT Response: This comment is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. The Department notes that it provides a comprehensive list of current consumer protections for air consumers at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights and an Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/disabilitybillofrights. Also, the Department has an open rulemaking to respond to section 429 of the 2018 FAA Act which directs the Department to require carriers to submit a one-page document that describes the rights of air consumers to the agency and require those carriers to make that document available on their websites.116 F. Compliance Period Proposal: The Department proposed a six-month implementation period for the rule\u2019s requirements. In support of the proposed six-month implementation period, the Department noted that, at the June 2022 ACPAC meeting, one airline representative indicated that, broadly speaking, sharing ancillary fee data with ticket agents is not technologically difficult and could be accomplished within a short time frame.117 The Department specifically sought comment on whether it should impose a date certain by which carriers must share ancillary service fee information with ticket agents. Comments: The ACPAC decided to refrain from recommending a specific timeframe for compliance with the final rule. Instead, the ACPAC recommended at its January 12, 2023, meeting that the Department should consider what can be done realistically, as well as the need for consumers to have ancillary fee information as soon as possible, in determining the timeframe for compliance with the final rule. A few groups representing consumers requested that the Department adopt either the six- month period from the NPRM or a shorter three-month implementation period. For example, 116 \u201cOne-Page Document on Passenger Rights\u201d (RIN 2015-AE82) is available in the Fall 2023 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Action at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202310&RIN=2105-AE82. 117 Remark of American Airlines, available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 afternoon session). AARP supported the proposed six-month compliance period, calling it a \u201creasonable amount of time\u201d and urged the Department to finalize and implement the rule quickly \u201cso that the benefits of fee disclosure can be extended to travelers as soon as possible.\u201d In addition, FlyersRights asked the Department to instead require a three-month implementation period. In support, it cited the June 2022 ACPAC testimony that the Department cited in the NPRM as evidence that airlines and ticket agents could implement the proposed rule more quickly. On the other hand, Travelers United commented that the significant technological changes required by the proposal would require additional time to implement. Industry commenters uniformly opposed the proposed six-month compliance period, stating that it was far too short and recommending significantly longer periods, with many stating at least three years was needed. Specifically, industry commenters raised concerns with the ability to complete data-sharing agreements, develop the proposed first page display of critical ancillary fees, display real-time, transactable family seating fees, and calculate and display passenger-specific fees within the six-month timeframe proposed. For example, A4A stated that a compliance period of at least three years was \u201cnecessary to provide time for all parties to re-engineer their own marketing platforms and re-design and re-engineer connections to other stake holders, especially with regard to family seating transactions and passenger- specific search information.\u201d IATA also recommended a three-year implementation period, citing prior challenges with data sharing using EDIFACT and testifying at the Department\u2019s March 30, 2023, hearing that providing transactable family seating fees would take years. In addition, Frontier Airlines suggested that required data sharing with ticket agents \u201cwould be measured in years, and perhaps decades,\u201d and American Airlines stated that \u201cto disclose passenger-specific ancillary fees on the first page of search results requires a highly complex reconfiguration\u201d of its distribution technology that \u201ccould take years to resolve.\u201d Other industry commenters suggested less than three years was needed but still emphasized that implementation of the proposal would take longer than the six months proposed. For example, USTOA recommended an implementation period of at least 18 months, Travelport suggested a period of 24 months (with the first 12 months for data sharing) if the Department elected not to require data sharing with GDSs, and Travel Tech stated that at least two years would be needed to display all critical ancillary fees at the first point in the search process where schedule and fare information is provided. Some industry commenters stated or suggested that their time estimates would be shorter if the Department modified its proposal. For example, American Airlines stated that if the Department allowed itinerary-specific disclosures later in the booking process, its \u201cestimate would change meaningfully.\u201d Bookings Holdings commented that its three-year implementation estimate could be reduced to two years if the Department required data sharing through GDSs and to 18 months if the Department allowed affirmative opt-ins or static rollovers, links, or pop- ups for the display of fees. Amadeus noted that \u201c[r]evision of the rules to allow more flexible displays and to eliminate the proposed requirement that all critical fee data be provided on the first search results page will go far to allow for timely and cost-efficient implementation.\u201d Travel Tech stated that the rule could possibly be implemented in as few as 18 months with modifications to the proposal. DOT Response: After carefully considering the comments received, the Department extends the proposed compliance period as follows: (1) airlines must share data with ticket agents as required in this rule not later than six months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or October 30, 2024; (2) airlines must meet the critical ancillary service fee disclosure requirements not later than 12 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or April 30, 2025; (3) ticket agents that do not meet the SBA definition of a small entity118 must meet the critical ancillary service fee disclosure requirements to consumers not later than 18 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or October 30, 2025; and (4) ticket agents that meet the SBA definition of small entity must meet 118 A ticket agent is a small entity if it has total annual revenues below $25 million See https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards, NAICS Code 561510. critical ancillary fee disclosure requirements to consumers not later than 24 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, or April 30, 2026. The additional six months for large ticket agents to comply beyond the deadline for airlines reflects that carriers already have access to the required ancillary fee information, but ticket agents cannot implement the disclosure requirements in this rule until data-sharing arrangements are complete. The longer implementation period for small ticket agents reflects that those businesses may require additional time for compliance as discussed in section E (1)(b). The Department believes that the implementation period set forth in this final rule is reasonable. The Department has modified several key aspects of the proposal in this final rule, \u2014including in areas that were of particular concern to industry commenters\u2014which will permit quicker implementation than the periods generally suggested by industry commenters. Among those significant changes, this final rule does not require display or transactability of family seating fees and provides additional flexibility in how critical ancillary fees must be disclosed, as requested by many commenters. In addition, while some commenters cited the requirement to provide passenger-specific fees as a challenge to timely implementation, the Department notes that some commenters appeared to misunderstand this requirement and mistakenly believed that information provided by the consumer would need to be validated before the airline or ticket agent could disclose passenger-specific fees, posing technological challenges. As discussed in section E (5), airlines and ticket agents may present passenger-specific ancillary fees based on the information provided by the consumer, and so this requirement should not significantly slow implementation. Finally, although this final rule does not require data sharing with GDSs as requested by some commenters to speed implementation, the Department expects that airlines and ticket agents will work in good faith to come to an agreement on the method used to transmit the ancillary fee information required by this final rule. Nothing in this final rule prevents airlines and ticket agents from voluntarily agreeing to use GDSs to distribute the ancillary fee information if that is their preferred method for meeting the rule\u2019s requirements within the timeframe provided. REGULATORY NOTICES Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The final rule meets the threshold for a significant regulatory action as defined in section (3)(f)(1) of E.O. 12866, \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d as amended by E.O. 14094, \u201cModernizing Regulatory Review,\u201d because it is likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more. Accordingly, the Department has prepared a regulatory impact analysis for the proposed rule, summarized in this section and available in the docket. Table X summarizes the results of the analysis. The final rule changes how U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose information about certain ancillary fees for flights. Expected benefits of the rule are due to the reduction of excess consumption of air travel, or deadweight loss, which occurs because consumers who are unaware of ancillary service fees behave as if the price for air travel is lower than it is. Annual benefits expected from reducing deadweight loss amount to $5.5 million. The other source of expected benefits is from the time consumers will save when they search for airfare because they no longer need to interrupt their search to find information on ancillary service fees. The amount in expected benefits due to time savings varies significantly depending on assumptions regarding the number of consumers who consider ancillary fee information when they search for airfare. Expected costs of this rule include costs to consumers uninterested in receiving this information due to the time needed to navigate increased amounts of information, which again, varies according to the percentage of consumers who consider ancillary fee information relevant to their purchase decision. The primary costs of the rule to carriers and ticket agents are the costs that they would incur to modify their websites to adjust their displays of fares, schedules, and fees. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as GDSs and direct-channel companies might incur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though the Department understands that these entities are already upgrading systems for market reasons and have been for several years. As shown in table X, the analysis considered two scenarios, each representing an alternative estimate regarding the percentage of consumers who consider ancillary fee information when they purchase airfare. Across the two scenarios, the estimate of annual net benefits ranges from $30 million to $254 million, indicating that this percentage is a key driver of the results. Formal uncertainty analysis suggests that the final rule might be expected to produce net societal benefits with a probability of about 53 percent under plausible assumptions about the percentage of consumers who consider ancillary fees when they purchase airfare. One effect of better information on ancillary fees, however, is that some consumers will pay less for the ancillary services they use when they travel by air. These economic effects are not societal benefits or costs but represent a transfer from airlines to consumers, estimated to be about $543 million annually. This transfer represents $543 million in overpayment in fees for consumers, or from the perspective of airlines, additional revenue from consumers who are surprised by fees and, for example, then need to pay a higher fee at the airport to check a bag. This transfer, as well as the benefits due to any reduction in deadweight loss, accrue to consumers and are expected to occur regardless of any time savings impacts. Table X: Summary of annual economic effects (millions of $2022) Annual amount Item Scenario 1* Scenario 2** Benefits Reduction in deadweight loss $5.5 $5.5 Reduction in search time for consumers interested in ancillary service fees $365.2 $484.3 when they search for airline tickets on airline sites Reduction in search time for consumers interested in ancillary service fees $37.4 $49.5 when they search for airline tickets on non-airline sites Total annualized benefits $408.1 $539.4 Costs Increased time navigating search results $330.8 $238.9 Annualized one-time and recurring costs for airlines to update price $32.1 $32.1 displays and provide fee information to ticket agents Annualized one-time and recurring costs for ticket agents to update price $13.9 $13.9 displays Annualized costs to ticket agents for offline disclosures $1.0 $1.0 Costs to GDSs and other third-parties engaged in data exchange to Unquantified Unquantified upgrade systems Total annualized costs $377.8 $285.9 Net benefits (costs) $30.3 $253.5 Transfers Reduction in prices paid for ancillary services (airlines to consumers) $543.1 $543.1 * Scenario 1: 46% of consumers consider ancillary fees when they search for airfare ** Scenario 2: 61% of consumers consider ancillary fees when they search for airfare Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 13132 (\u201cFederalism\u201d). This final rule does not include any requirement that (1) has substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the National Government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, (2) imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, or (3) preempts State law. States are already preempted from regulating in this area by the Airline Deregulation Act, 49 U.S.C. 41713. Therefore, the consultation and funding requirements of E.O. 13132 do not apply. Executive Order 13175 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 13175 (\u201cConsultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments\u201d). Because none of the provisions of this final rule will significantly or uniquely affect the communities of the Indian tribal governments or impose substantial direct compliance costs on them, the funding and consultation requirements of E.O. 13175 do not apply. Regulatory Flexibility Act When a Federal agency is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the agency to conduct a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). A FRFA describes the impact of the rule on small entities and describes the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes (5 U.S.C. 604). A FRFA is not required if the agency head certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 605). The Department has prepared a FRFA for this final rule, set forth in the paragraphs that follow. DOT has provided a statement of the need for, and objectives of, the rule elsewhere in the preamble and does not restate them here. In the preamble to this final rule, DOT responds to the comments received on the economic impacts of the rule, including on small entities, and provides DOT\u2019s assessment of those comments and any changes made as a result of those comments (e.g., the extended compliance period, exclusion of corporate travel agents, removal of family seat fee disclosure and transactability, flexibilities provided in the way carriers and ticket agents display ancillary fee information, and permitting baggage and change and cancellation policies to be displayed later in the booking process). DOT does not repeat that information here. The Department\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis developed in support of this final rule also provides information on the economic impacts of the final rule, as modified in response to public comments and further consideration by the Department. DOT did not receive comments from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in response to the proposed rule. Description of and an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply. The rule will have some impact on U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers and ticket agents that qualify as small entities. It would also have some impact on GDSs, but none of the three major GDS companies in the market (Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport) qualify as small businesses. A carrier is a small entity if it provides air transportation exclusively with small aircraft, defined as any aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of 60 seats or less or a maximum payload capacity of 18,000 pounds or less, as described in 14 CFR 399.73. In 2020, 28 carriers meeting these criteria reported passenger traffic data to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.119 A ticket agent is a small entity if it has total annual revenues below $25 million.120 This amount excludes funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to commissions, but includes commissions received. In 2017, the latest year with available data, 7,827 travel agency establishments had annual revenues of less than $25 million.121 Description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record. The final rule would have impacts on small entities because carriers and ticket agents would incur costs to modify websites and upgrade systems to exchange ancillary fee data. The Department stated in its initial regulatory flexibility analysis prepared in support of the proposed rule that because the Department could not estimate these costs reliably, it could not determine whether the proposed rule would impose a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For this final rule, the Department estimated that the primary costs of the rule to carriers and ticket agents are the costs that they would incur to modify their websites by adjusting their displays of fares, schedules, and fees. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as GDSs and direct-channel companies might incur some costs due the need to upgrade their systems, though 119 Bureau of Transportation Statistics. No date. \u201cT1: U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Summary by Service Class.\u201d https://transtats.bts.gov/. 120 See https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards, NAICS Code 561510. 121 U.S. Census Bureau. 2022. \u201cEconomic Census.\u201d https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic- census.html. the Department understands that these entities are already upgrading systems for market reasons and have been for several years. DOT estimated quantified costs range from $658 million to $1.5 billion annually. The Department acknowledges that some portion of these costs would be incurred by small entities. Description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, including a statement of the factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which affect the impact on small entities was rejected. The Department considered several alternatives to the measures adopted in this final rule. In this section, the Department describes the steps taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the objectives of 49 U.S.C. 41712 and the other authorities discussed in the Statutory Authorities section of this final rule. The Department proposed to cover U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that advertise or sell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agents, OTAs or metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers. The final rule defers for a separate rulemaking a determination on whether metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers are ticket agents subject to the disclosure requirements in this rule. To ensure consumers have access to critical ancillary service fee information under this final rule while metasearch entities are excluded from the rule\u2019s disclosure requirements, the Department requires that airlines and ticket agents display the required critical ancillary service fee information on the landing page on the airline or ticket agent\u2019s online platform to which consumers are directed after using a metasearch site. The Department believes that this option best balances the concerns that more examination is needed in the Department\u2019s separate rulemaking on ticket agents before the Department determines whether to cover metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers as ticket agents required to disclose critical ancillary fee and policy information to consumers. The final rule also excludes corporate travel agents from the final rule\u2019s requirements. Ancillary fee disclosures by those agents are the subject of contractual agreements between a business client and the travel agent, with the relevant ancillary services and fees negotiated as part of the contract. Moreover, the fees often are irrelevant for corporate clients, and are not a significant consideration in corporate travelers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The corporate client, not the business traveler, generally pays the cost of transportation, including fees. The benefits of covering corporate agents would therefore be limited but would involve costs. The Department also considered differing compliance periods for the requirements established in the rule. In the proposed rule, the Department proposed a compliance period of 6 months for all covered entities to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements. The Department received comment that additional time was needed for compliance, including from small entities. In consideration of these comments, the Department requires in this final rule that: (1) airlines must provide fee and policy information of critical ancillary services to entities required to disclose this information directly to consumers no later than six months after this rule\u2019s publication date, (2) airlines must comply with all other regulatory requirements not later than 12 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, (3) ticket agents that do not meet the SBA definition of small entity must comply with all regulatory requirements not later than 18 months after this rule\u2019s publication date, and (4) ticket agents that that meet the SBA definition of small entity must comply with all regulatory requirements not later than 24 months after this rule\u2019s publication date. In the proposed rule, DOT would have required airlines and ticket agents to provide fee information for first and second checked bags, carry-on bags, and change and cancellation fees in text form next to the fare information provided to consumers. On consideration of comments that the proposed requirements would result in screen clutter and be potentially confusing to consumers, the Department determined in this final rule to allow fee information to be displayed using pop-ups, expandable text, or other means except for hyperlinks as long as the disclosure is clear and conspicuous. This is intended to minimize clutter and allow airlines and ticket agents flexibility in how they disclose information. The Department also allows some information\u2014 specifically, airline policies for baggage and ticket changes and cancellations\u2014later in the process, as long as the disclosure occurs before ticket purchase. Policy information can be displayed using hyperlinks. The Department believes that these additional flexibilities will reduce costs to airlines and assist consumers because airlines will be able to present the information in a manner that, while clear and conspicuous, is not confusing to consumers. In this final rule, the Department also made changes to the proposed requirements for offline disclosures. In the proposed rule, the Department required these disclosures to be made for every quoted itinerary. The Department received comments that such disclosures would add a significant amount of \u201ctalk time\u201d that would burden airlines and ticket agents with having to provide the information and consumers with having to spend time listening to the disclosures even if the information was not relevant to them. As a result of these comments, the Department is finalizing a requirement that airlines and ticket agents inform consumers purchasing air travel offline about whether a critical ancillary fee applies to the itinerary being quoted and give the consumer an opportunity to request information on the fee. The airline or ticket agent must then provide the critical ancillary fee information upon request of the consumer. This modification is expected to reduce extra time spent on the phone, which will benefit not only airlines and ticket agents, but also consumers who will not have to listen to information not relevant to them. The Department considered whether to apply the disclosure requirements to all online platforms, in addition to computer websites. The Department finalizes the requirement that the disclosure requirements apply to all online platforms in this final rule. While this option may increase costs, the Department determined that it was necessary to ensure consumers received the same information on critical ancillary fees and policies regardless of the online platform used to purchase their tickets for air travel. DOT also considered whether to require disclosure of family seating fees in this rulemaking and to make those fees transactable by ticket agents. The Department is not finalizing the proposal to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose applicable fees for passengers 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult on an aircraft, and to make those fees transactable. Instead, the Department is pursuing a separate rulemaking to address the issue of a young child being able to sit adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional cost beyond the fare. Not requiring family seating disclosures and fee transactability reduces the cost burden on airlines and ticket agents. Paperwork Reduction Act In this final rule, the Department imposes new collections of information that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13, 49 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The Department also amends an existing collection of information, 2105-0561, in this final rule, with regard to the requirements for customer service plans. The Department has sought approval from OMB for the collections of information established in this final rule and will also seek approval for the amendment to the collection approved under OMB Control No. 2105-0561 as part of the renewal of that OMB control number, due to expire August 31, 2024. The Department will publish a separate notice in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval of the new and amended collections and advising the public of the associated OMB control numbers. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if the collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control number. Industry commenters generally expressed the view that the proposed rule\u2019s disclosure requirements would impose significant burdens on industry. Many airlines stated that the disclosure requirements would require a reconfiguration of their processes. A study of the NPRM commissioned by A4A estimated $33 billion in costs to airlines over 10 years. A4A estimated that the initial airline cost of implementation would be $86.5 million and $9 million annually for maintenance and additional development. American Airlines stated that over 100,000 engineering hours would be required to begin reworking the search process on the airline\u2019s desktop website and other platforms. Booking Holdings and USTOA stated that the Department\u2019s PRA analysis in the NPRM greatly underestimated burdens for planning, development, and programming by ticket agents to provide online displays of ancillary fee information on their websites. In addition, Booking Holdings estimated that the initial costs of engineering and testing the required displays, including to ensure readability and timeliness, would be multiple millions of dollars per entity covered by the regulation for initial development. Similarly, while USTOA did not provide an alternative burden hour estimate, USTOA stated that the 80 hours per entity that DOT estimated for programming, data management, website modification, and other related costs was an underestimate, given what it characterized as the \u201cextensive and ongoing website revisions that would be necessary to compile ancillary fee options,\u201d122 and that the hourly wage of $45.90/hour used by the Department for web and interface designs was too low.123 Booking Holdings and USTOA asserted that the Department was incorrect to assume no costs for ongoing website maintenance by ticket agents. Instead, Booking Holdings estimated that the proposal would impose annual maintenance costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars per entity/ticket agent, stating that the proposal would require ticket agents to employ \u201cmultiple full time engineers/developers, a project manager, and a full-time quality assurance associate to ensure that dynamic displays continue to operate appropriately\u201d and to periodically update and maintain hardware associated with the searches, for example, as carriers update and change their ancillary service fee policies. Further, Booking Holdings stated that the Department failed to account for any costs of negotiating new data-sharing agreements with carriers. A4A estimated that $8.8 million would be spent to supply data to agents. 122 USTOA further stated that the costs of complying with the full fare rule were not analogous to the costs of displaying complex ancillary fee information, as DOT suggested. 123 USTOA stated that an inflation adjustment of the Department\u2019s estimated hourly rate for such services from the 2014 NPRM would result in an hourly of wage of $142.85/hour for a total annual cost to ticket agents of \u201cat least $6,856,800.\u201d In USTOA\u2019s view, the Department underestimated the number of ticket agents who would be required to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements, given the rule\u2019s applicability to offline transactions. USTOA and ASTA also disagreed with the Department\u2019s assessment that orally conveying the proposed ancillary fee information in offline transactions would involve only a \u201cmarginal increase in time\u201d with minimal burden. ASTA estimated that 17.2 million offline transactions are completed each year by ticket agents and that the proposed disclosures for offline transactions would add at least 20 seconds to each offline transaction at an estimated cost of $21.3 million per year in \u201ctalk time\u201d for ticket agents. The Department has carefully considered public comments regarding the costs of the information collections required by this rule and reexamined the burden estimates presented in this section in light of the regulatory impact analysis developed in support of the final rule. As noted above, the Department has made modifications in this final rule that may have differing effects on the information collection burdens implicated by the NPRM. In contrast to the NPRM, the final rule does not impose a requirement to disclose family seating fees and provides additional flexibility in how critical ancillary fee information is disclosed and when policy information is disclosed. The final rule also extends information collection requirements to online platforms, which includes mobile applications. Based on comments that the hours used to account for the initial information disclosures in the NPRM was too low and comments that the rule\u2019s impact on maintenance and other ongoing costs is measurable (recognizing, however, that regulated entities have already been operating and maintaining their own online platforms prior to implementation of this rule), the Department increased the number of hours per entity that DOT estimated for programming, data management, website modification, and other related costs from 80 to 120 and also added additional burden hours for ongoing maintenance of online platforms. The Department also updated the applicable hourly wage from $45.90 to $53.27. The updated hourly wage was calculated using an hourly rate of $53.27 for computer programmers, which is based on a median wage of $40.02 for web and digital interface designers from the BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics from May 2022, multiplied by 1.41 to account for employee benefits and other costs to employers. The Department has also updated the number of ticket agents to whom this rule would apply using data from the US Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census based on NAICS Code 561501 Travel Agencies. The Department also accepts commenters\u2019 arguments that the rule imposes a measurable burden on offline transactions and has added this additional burden to its estimates. The Department has not added costs of negotiating new data-sharing agreements between ticket agents and carriers because contract negotiations are a cost that carriers and ticket agents incur to do business and are not a paperwork burden for purposes of the PRA. The Department has consolidated all the information collections involving the disclosure of critical ancillary fees and policies into one information collection (i.e., the 24-hour cancellation and hold policy disclosure is included in the information collection for change and cancellation fee and bag fee disclosures). Consolidating the information collections better reflects the burden of respondents to implement the changes to their online platforms to implement this rule\u2019s disclosure requirements. At the same time, the Department is separately estimating the burden for offline disclosures of bag, change, and cancellation fees, as the labor type involved is substantially different from other disclosures in this rule. This rule requires three information collections: (1) U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents must disclose, during the online booking process, applicable fee and policy information for the first and second checked baggage and for carry-on baggage, and applicable fee and policy information for changing and cancelling reservations (including 24-hour cancellation or reservation hold policy); (2) U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents in offline transactions must disclose that bag, change, or cancellation fees apply to a quoted itinerary and disclose such fees upon request, and (3) U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers must ensure that entities to which they provide fare, schedule, and availability information that display or sell the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers receive information regarding baggage fee rules and policies as well as ticket change and cancellation fees and policies, if the entities are required to disclose this information to consumers. For each of the information collections, the title, a description of the respondents, and an estimate of the burdens are set forth below: 1. Requirement that U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose, during the online booking process, the applicable fee and policy information for the first and second checked baggage, one carry-on bag, and the applicable fee and policy information for changing and canceling reservation (including 24-hour cancellation or reservation hold policy). Title: Disclosure of Ancillary Fees and Policies During the Air Transportation Booking Process Respondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or display carrier fare and schedule information to consumers in the United States. Number of Respondents: We estimate that as many as 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers and as many as 7,497 ticket agents may be impacted by this requirement. Our estimate is based on the following information and assumptions: Ticket agents includes OTAs, brick-and- mortar travel agencies, and tour operators that market airline tickets. We updated our number of ticket agents based on data from NAICS code 561510 (Source: US Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census), although not all of those entities market air transportation online to consumers in the United States. In addition, most ticket agents rely on GDSs to create online fare and schedule displays. GDSs and entities that create or develop and maintain their own online fare and schedule displays, such as many of the impacted carriers and the largest travel agents, will incur some planning, development, and programming costs to reprogram their systems to provide online displays of fare and schedule information that includes baggage fee information on their websites. Thus, our estimate of the number of impacted ticket agents may be overstated.124 Many smaller carriers also rely on GDSs to create online fare and schedule displays, so our estimate of 206 impacted carriers may be overstated. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 133 hours per respondent (120 hours of initial display updates and 13 hours for ongoing maintenance). We base our estimate on the following information and assumptions: the primary costs to respondents for the disclosure requirement would arise from programming, data management, website modification, and other related costs to carriers and ticket agents to display the required ancillary fee information. The Department has modified the estimated annual burden on respondents to account for the following: extension of this rule to online platforms, which have increased in usage; an incremental increase in one time and ongoing costs to maintain online platforms; inclusion of 24- hour cancellation and hold policy disclosures in this information collection;125 and a reduction in burden from removal of the proposed requirement for family seating fee disclosures.126 The more significant burdens in this rulemaking are expected to be incurred one time by regulated entities. Once the modifications required by this information collection have been incorporated into the online platforms of regulated entities, we expect that this information collection will impose smaller additional ongoing costs, such as website maintenance, beyond what regulated entities were already incurring for operating online platforms prior to the promulgation of this rulemaking. In response to the comments received on this point, however, the Department estimates that this information collection adds approximately 13 hours of burden 124 In the NPRM, we assumed for the PRA analysis that about five percent of United States ticket agents, including GDSs and large travel agencies would be impacted by this requirement. In the Department\u2019s FRIA developed in support of this final rule, however, the cost estimates for ticket agents included the total number of ticket agents who may incur costs, or 7,497. Therefore, we do not include the five percent assumption in our PRA analysis for the final rule and instead assume all ticket agents are impacted. This is consistent with the approach taken for airlines, even though smaller airlines may also use GDSs. 125 The NPRM estimated an average annual burden of 80 hours per respondent for the design, programming, and modification of websites to provide disclosure of 24-hour cancellation or hold information. The Department believes this number was an overestimate due to the static nature of this disclosure (i.e., the disclosure should not have noticeable variation due to the relatively stagnant nature of 24-hour cancellation or hold policies). Such policies also exist generally unchanged in carrier customer service plans. The burden is also reduced as this final rule does not require this disclosure if the ticket is purchased within 7 days of the flight. 126 The Department acknowledges USTOA\u2019s comment that the burdens of this rulemaking are not analogous to those in the full fare rule (76 FR 23110). The Department has taken this comment into account in increasing the paperwork burdens in this analysis, including the considerations noted above. per respondent to maintain online platform systems. This rulemaking does not require the creation of new websites or online platforms by regulated entities that did not already maintain such online platforms for the purpose of selling air transportation. Estimated Total Annual Burden: Approximately 1,024,499 hours for all respondents (based on an assumption of 27,398 hours for carriers (24,720 hours for the initial upgrade and 2,678 hours for ongoing costs) and 997,101 hours for ticket agents (899,640 hours for the initial upgrade and 97,461 hours for ongoing maintenance costs)). Based on an estimated median hourly wage of $53.27 for web and digital interface designers,127 this results in a total annual cost of $49,240,657 ($1,316,834 for carriers and $47,923,823 for ticket agents) for the first year. Note that after the initial costs are incurred, the annual cost will decrease to an estimated $142,657 per year for carriers and $5,191,747 per year for ticket agents. Frequency: One time incorporation of information into online platform displays and ongoing costs (such as for maintenance). Costs are annual. 2. U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents in offline transactions must disclose that bag, change, or cancellation fees apply to a quoted itinerary and disclose such fees upon request. Title: Disclosure of Ancillary Fees During the Offline Booking Process Respondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or market tickets to U.S. consumers by phone or in-person Number of Respondents: We estimate that as many as 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers and as many as 7,497 ticket agents may be impacted by this requirement. We base our estimate on the following information and assumptions: Ticket agents includes OTAs, brick-and- mortar travel agencies, and tour operators that market airline tickets. There may be an estimated 127 The median base wage for web and digital interface developers in 2022 was $37.78, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151254.htm. We multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf. 7,497 travel agencies in the United States, based on data from NAICS code 561510 (Source: US Census Bureau, 2017 Economic Census), although not all of those entities market air transportation by phone or in-person to U.S. consumers. Many carriers and ticket agents may not offer sales to U.S. consumers by phone or in-person; therefore, our estimate of 7,497 impacted ticket agents and 206 impacted carriers may be overstated. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 4 hours per respondent. This information collection adds additional disclosures to in-person or phone transactions when a ticket is marketed to U.S. consumers. The time required to provide the additional disclosure is not expected to be significant, and some consumers may not request additional disclosures. The rule would require entities selling tickets marketed to U.S. consumers by phone or in-person to inform consumers about certain ancillary service fees at the time a fare is quoted. The Department estimates that respondents will incur 4.3 additional hours of burden on average annually on providing the offline disclosures required by this rule. Estimated Total Annual Burden: Approximately 33,123 hours for all respondents (based on an assumption of 886 hours for carriers and 32,237 hours for ticket agents). Based on an estimated median hourly wage of $31.46 for travel agents,128 this results in a total annual cost of $1,042,050 ($27,874 for carriers and $1,014,176 for ticket agents). The PRA estimate developed here supports a determination that the additional \u201ctalk time\u201d for carriers is de minimis. Frequency: This information collection imposes an additional cost for carriers and ticket agents for each interaction between a consumer and the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s in-person or telephone reservation agents. Costs are annual. 3. Requirement that U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers ensure that entities to which they provide fare, schedule, and availability information to display or sell the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers receive information regarding baggage fee 128 The median base wage for travel agents in 2022 was $22.31, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes413041.htm. We multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf. rules and ticket change and cancellation fees and policies, if the entities are required to disclose this information to consumers. Title: Disclosure of critical ancillary fee information to other entities required to disclose fee information to consumers. Respondents: U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers that provide fare, schedule, and availability information to ticket agents to sell or display flights within, to, or from the United States. Number of Respondents: We estimate that approximately 206 carriers will be impacted by this requirement. This includes foreign carriers that may not serve the United States on their own equipment but may sell connecting itineraries between the United States and a foreign point, when at least one of the foreign-to-foreign segments is operated by the foreign carrier. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 30 hours per respondent. The information collection requires carriers to either distribute baggage and change and cancellation fee rules or make the specific rules, including the calculation of baggage and change and cancellation fees applicable for passenger-specific itineraries, available to third parties. Carriers selling tickets in the United States already display baggage and ancillary fee information on their websites, as required by existing regulation (14 CFR 399.85(d)). This information includes the use of baggage fee calculators and other tables accessible to consumers. The rulemaking requires that this information be made available in such a way that other entities to which they provide fare, schedule, and availability information to display or sell the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers have access to this information in a non-static, dynamic format such that the entities can disclose baggage fee and change and cancellation fee information to consumers during each itinerary search. The Department adjusted its number of burden hours per respondent based on comments suggesting that the cost of data sharing with ticket agents is higher than the Department initially estimated. Several carriers, however, already share this information with other entities by agreement, which suggests that the added cost of implementing any modifications required by this rule may be limited for many carriers. This potential burden of 30 hours per respondent, as referenced here, may overestimate the actual burden for most carriers. Estimated Total Annual Burden: This information collection would result in an estimated annual burden of 6,180 hours. Based on an estimated mean hourly wage of $66.30 for computer programmers,129 this results in a total cost of approximately $409,734. Frequency: This information collection imposes an additional cost for carriers to provide information on critical ancillary fees to ticket agents required to disclose this information to consumers. Costs are annual. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1501, requires agencies to prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules that include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditures by States, local, or Tribal governments, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation with base year of 1995) in any one year. The 2023 threshold after adjustment for inflation is $198 million, using the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. The assessment may be included in conjunction with other assessments, and the Department has provided the assessment required by UMRA within the RIA prepared in support of the final rule. National Environmental Policy Act The Department has analyzed the environmental impacts of this action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and has determined that it is categorically excluded pursuant to DOT Order 5610.1C, Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts (44 FR 56420, Oct. 1, 1979). Categorical exclusions are actions identified in an agency\u2019s NEPA implementing procedures that do not normally have a significant impact on the environment and therefore do not require either an environmental assessment (EA) 129 The median base wage for computer programmers in 2022 was $47.02, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151251.htm. We multiply this by 1.41 to account for benefits, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_09202022.pdf. or environmental impact statement (EIS).130 In analyzing the applicability of a categorical exclusion, the agency must also consider whether extraordinary circumstances are present that would warrant the preparation of an EA or EIS.131 Paragraph 4(c)(6)(i) of DOT Order 5610.1C provides that \u201cactions relating to consumer protection, including regulations\u201d are categorically excluded. The purpose of this rulemaking is to enhance protections for air travelers and to improve the air travel experience. The Department does not anticipate any environmental impacts, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present in connection with this rulemaking. Congressional Review Act Pursuant to subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (the Congressional Review Act), OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has found that this rule falls within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

For the reasons stated in the preamble, DOT amends 14 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and F, as follows: PART 259 \u2013 ENHANCED PROTECTIONS FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS 1. The authority citation for part 259 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4), 40101(a)(9), 40113(a), 41702, 41708, 41712, and 42301. 2. Amend \u00a7 259.5 by: a. Revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(4); b. Removing the word \u201cand\u201d at the end of paragraph (b)(13); c. Removing the period at the end of paragraph (b)(14) and adding \u201c; and\u201d in its place; and d. Adding paragraph (b)(15). The revisions and addition read as follows: \u00a7 259.5 Customer Service Plan. (a) Adoption of Plan. Each covered carrier must adopt a Customer Service Plan applicable to its scheduled flights as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (15) of this section and adhere to the plan\u2019s . (b) * * * (4) Allowing reservations to be held at the quoted fare without payment, or cancelled without penalty, for at least twenty-four hours after the reservation is made if the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight\u2019s departure, and disclosing its chosen twenty-four hour policy on the last page of the booking process; * * * * * (15) Disclosing critical ancillary service fees to consumers on the carrier\u2019s online platform or when a customer contacts the carrier\u2019s reservation center to inquire about a fare or make a reservation in person or by telephone and disclosing policies for critical ancillary service fees to consumers on the carrier\u2019s online platform as required by \u00a7 399.85 of this chapter. * * * * * PART 399 \u2013 STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY 3. The authority citation for part 399 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 40113(a), 41712, 46106, and 46107. 4. Amend \u00a7 399.80 by revising the introductory text, adding paragraph (o), and revising paragraph (s) to read as follows: \u00a7 399.80 Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents. It is the policy of the Department to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (o) of this section by a ticket agent of any size and the practice enumerated in paragraph (s) of this section by a ticket agent that sells air transportation online and is not considered a small business under the Small Business Administration\u2019s size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201: * * * * * (o) Failing to disclose ancillary service fee information as required by \u00a7 399.85. * * * * * (s) Failing to disclose and offer web-based discount fares to prospective passengers who contact the agent through other channels (e.g., by telephone or in the agent\u2019s place of business) and indicate they are unable to use the agent\u2019s website due to a disability. 5. Amend \u00a7 399.84 by revising paragraph (a) and adding paragraphs (d) and (e) to read as follows: \u00a7 399.84 Price advertising and opt-out provisions. (a) The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price for such air transportation, tour, or tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price (all mandatory charges) to be paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour component. Mandatory charges refer to all taxes and fees that are required to purchase air transportation on the channel where the advertising or solicitation occurs (e.g., if a fare is advertised online for $100 then that means the fare must be available for the consumer to purchase for $100 online). Mandatory charges included within the single total price listed may be stated separately or through links or \u201cpop ups\u201d on online platforms that display the total price, but such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed prominently, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the mandatory charge. * * * * * (d) A carrier or ticket agent may display a price that includes all mandatory charges and one or more ancillary service fees (i.e., fees charged for any optional service related to air travel beyond passenger air transportation) in place of or more prominently than a price that only includes all mandatory charges. (e) The Department considers any offer of a percentage-off discount for passenger air transportation or for a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, that does not make clear at the outset the  and  of the offer, including how the discount is calculated, to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712. When used in any advertising or solicitation, the term \u201cbase fare\u201d must refer to an amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed charges and the  \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare\u201d must refer to an amount that includes all mandatory carrier-imposed and government charges. 6. Revise \u00a7 399.85 to read as follows: \u00a7 399.85 Notice of ancillary service fees. (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: Air transportation means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) and (25). Ancillary service fee means the fee charged for any optional service related to air travel that a U.S. or foreign air carrier provides beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees may include, but are not limited to, fees for checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment programs, in-flight beverages, lounge access, snacks and meals, pillows and blankets, and seat upgrades. Ancillary service package means a package or bundle of one or more ancillary services offered for sale by a carrier or ticket agent. Anonymous itinerary search means a search that does not take into account information specific to the passenger but does take into account information specific to the itinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied. Break in journey means a deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where a stopover at a foreign point is scheduled. The factors to consider to determine whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption include whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time. Clear and conspicuous means that a disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily noticeable), easily understandable by consumers, and presented in a manner that allows consumers to determine the true cost and enable them to select the best flight options for them. Critical ancillary service means any ancillary service critical to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Such services are: transporting the first checked bag, the second checked bag, or a carry-on bag, the ability for a consumer to cancel or change a reservation, and any other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary. Consumer or user refers to a person who seeks to obtain information about or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent, whether through an online platform or other means (e.g., over the telephone, in person). Corporate travel agent refers to a ticket agent engaged in providing travel services to the employees of a business entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business travel of its employees. Online platform refers to any interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent. Passenger-specific itinerary search means a search that takes into account information specific to the passenger (e.g., the passenger\u2019s status in the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, the passenger\u2019s military status, or the passenger\u2019s status as a holder of a particular credit card) that was affirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the itinerary (e.g., geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied. (b) Passenger-specific and anonymous itinerary searches. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that advertises or sells air transportation marketed to U.S. consumers must offer consumers both the option to conduct a passenger-specific itinerary search and the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search. (c) Online disclosures of ancillary service fees--(1) Critical ancillary service fees. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform the accurate fee that applies, if any, for all critical ancillary services. The fee cannot be designated as $0 in circumstances where a critical ancillary service is not available to the consumer but rather must state \u201cnot available\u201d or a similar notation. The fee information must be provided the first time that fare and schedule information is disclosed after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search. The fees cannot be displayed through a hyperlink. (2) Other ancillary service fees. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation may disclose ancillary service fees that are not critical ancillary service fees at the same time as critical ancillary service fees. (3) Ancillary service packages. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must disclose the standalone fee for each critical ancillary service required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section when fare and schedule information is provided. Nothing in this section requires or prohibits a carrier or ticket agent from disclosing an ancillary service package that includes critical ancillary services if it chooses to do so. (4) Air tour packages. Each ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air tour packages must clearly and conspicuously disclose, at the time the ticket agent offers a package fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a consumer, where the carrier providing air transportation is not known, that additional fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. When the carrier providing air transportation for an air-tour package is known, that ticket agent must provide baggage fee information as prescribed by this paragraph (c) at the time that the ticket agent discloses the name of the carrier to the consumer. (5) Website disclosure of all ancillary service fees. A U.S. or foreign air carrier that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its website accurate information on ancillary service fees available to a passenger purchasing air transportation with a clear and conspicuous link from the carrier\u2019s homepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such ancillary services and related fees are disclosed. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however, baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (e.g., frequent flyer status, early purchase) that affect those charges. (d) Online disclosure of baggage policies. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the accurate weight and dimension limitations that the carrier imposes for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search. (e) Intent to travel with a bag.

The information provided must be useable, current, accurate, and sufficient to ensure compliance by such entities. (m) Unfair and deceptive practice.

However, they do not have this right if the cancellation is caused by extraordinary circumstances (i.e. political instability, meteorological  incompatible with the operation of the flight concerned, security risks, unexpected flight safety shortcomings, strikes, etc.), which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. e) When an operating air carrier reasonably expects a flight to be delayed beyond its scheduled time of departure: \u2022 for two hours or more in the case of flights of 1 500 kilometres or less; or \u2022 for three hours or more in the case of all intra-Community flights of more than 1 500 kilometres and of all extra- Community flights between 1 500 and 3 500 kilometres; or \u2022 for four hours or more in the case of all extra-Community flights of 3500 km and more, the passengers has the right to care provided by the operating air carrier (see Article 13.2d) above). If, for reasons other than exceptional circumstances, the passenger arrives at their final destination three hours or more later than originally scheduled by the air carrier, passengers on such flights will be treated as passengers of cancelled flights in order to exercise their right for compensation (see Article 13.2 par.d) above). When the delay is at least five hours or more, the passenger also has the right to assistance consisting of reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought within 7 days, i.e. for the part or parts of the journey not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose in relation to their original travel plan, together with, when relevant, a return flight to the first point of departure, at the earliest opportunity. f) The passenger does not have these rights if the air carrier and its servants and agents took all the measures that could reasonable be required to avoid the damage or it was impossible for them to take such measures. The passenger also does not have these rights if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the passenger or the person from whom they derive their rights. 13.3 Payment of compensations a) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the procedure for the enforcement of passengers' claims for compensation in the event of denied boarding, cancellation or significant flight delays pursuant to Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No 261/2004 and to the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. b) If the passenger is represented by a third party in the recovery of the claim, the third party is obliged to prove to the carrier the right to represent such passenger by means of a written Power of Attorney to represent the claimant for compensation with the officially authenticated signature of such a passenger. c) In accordance with the carrier's internal procedures, in order to promote transparency of payments and to protect the consumer, any compensation will be paid only to the account from which the ticket has been paid, unless the passenger communicates to the carrier another bank account of the passenger where the payment is to be paid. In such case, the Passenger is obliged to prove to the carrier the ownership of such an account. 20 14. REIMBURSEMENT 14.1 Reimbursement of air tickets on schedule flights of Smartwings a) If the Carrier cancels the flight, the Passenger will be refunded as follows: \u2022 The amount equal to the price of air ticket including any related paid charges, if neither part of air ticket was used; \u2022 The amount equal to the difference between the total price of air ticket and the price for the part of flight, where the air ticket was used including any related paid charges for a not-flown part of flight, if the air ticket was used partly. b) In the event of death of a closest family member such as mother, father, brother, sister, child or grandparent, the carrier shall upon request undertake the money refund at the level of price of the air ticket or its non-flown part. c) If a Passenger, for reasons other than those mentioned in section b), decides not to fly and use any section of an air ticket, he/she will be refunded the cost of the airport taxes after deducting an administrative fee. The fares and other charges are not refundable, unless stated otherwise in the tariff  of the air ticket. 14.2 Reimbursement of air tickets on charter flights a) In the event of carriage pursuant to Article 2.2 of these  (Charter Flights), the flight ordering party shall be liable to reimburse the air tickets. 14.3 A person entitled to reimbursement a) Except as otherwise provided hereinafter, the Carrier shall be entitled to make a refund either to the person named in the Ticket or, to the person who has paid for the Ticket, upon presentation of satisfactory proof of such payment.. b) The passenger named in the Ticket or the person who paid for the Ticket can authorize a third person to receive a refund for an unused ticket or a portion thereof. c) Except in the case of a lost Ticket, refunds will only be made on surrender to the Carrier of the Ticket and all unused Flight Coupons as well as the confirmation and the bill, if applicable. d) Refund to the person presenting the coupon along with the unused portions of the Ticket and a bill (if applicable), according to Article 14.3 par.a) and par.b) is considered as refund to the authorized person and shall release the Carrier from any further liability. 14.4 Currency a) All refunds are subject to the laws of the state where the Ticket was sold and the country where the refund is made. The refund shall be in the currency used to pay for the Ticket. In particular cases, when a refund in the currency used to pay for the Ticket is not possible, the Carrier shall refund in the currency used in the country in which the refund is paid or any other currency agreed between the Carrier and the person entitled to a refund in accordance with the law. 14.5 Right to refuse refund a) The Carrier may refuse refund until it receives proof of payment from a Passenger or another person who paid for the Ticket. b) The Carrier may decide to refuse a refund on a Ticket which has been presented to it, or to Government officials, as evidence of intention to depart from that country, unless the Passenger establishes to the Carrier\u2019s satisfaction that the Passenger has permission to remain in the country or that he/she will depart from that country by another carrier or another means of transport. c) The Carrier may refuse refund for an unused Ticket or a portion of a Ticket, if the Ticket or a portion thereof was unused due to the reasons set out in Article 9.1) and the Carrier has decided to secure the Ticket or a portion thereof in order to satisfy claims for the damages caused to another passenger or the Carrier. 21 15. TRAVEL FORMALITIES 15.1 General a) The passenger is obliged to obtain all documents and fulfill all  required by the authorities of departure, transit, transfer, or arrival country.

New interline relationships will be a vital enabler for industry recovery, providing traffic for airlines and connectivity for passengers. Airlines may need to pursue new and more varied relationships to support their networks as they recover, and to allow them to serve more origin \u2013 destination markets as their operations restart and their networks are restored. A need has been identified to provide carriers with a Guidance Document on baggage standards covering the end to end interline processes. This is part of the package of work built by airlines in the Interline Group around the reinvigorating of the multilateral framework and supporting airlines to ease the formation of new partnerships. This document provides an overview of the main processes and recommendations to support the handling and carriage of baggage when the routing involves other carriers. The information contained in this document is based on the IATA Resolutions and Recommended Practices adopted at the annual IATA Passenger Standards Conference (PSC) and published in the Passenger Standards Conference Manual, effective from 1 June 2020. If bilaterally agreed, airlines may apply different rules and exceptions to standard procedures. Each airline shall ensure that all the internal teams know and abide by all applicable anti-trust regulations and limitations. 4  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Baggage definition Each airline is responsible to set its own rules permitting customers to transport baggage. These rules can vary according to passenger\u2019s Frequent Flyer status, the product and services purchased and/or the selected route(s). IATA plays no role in this activity and IATA\u2019s primary focus is to develop Standards and best practices around baggage management, including the tracking and tracing of mishandled bags. These rules and policies are usually defined for the following main types of baggage: \u2022 Carry-on or cabin baggage - defined as the baggage that is carried and stowed in the aircraft cabin under the passengers\u2019 control and custody. \u2022 Checked-in baggage - defined as the baggage for which the carrier takes custody, issues, validates or updates a baggage tag. It is important that passengers are clearly informed on the baggage carry-on rules they should comply with, together with their entitlement for checked-in baggage (if applicable) and charges for excess items or overweight/oversized items. Baggage rules are complex, and there are many different models that carriers use to determine a passenger\u2019s baggage entitlement, or the pricing structure for baggage that is not included in the passenger fare. That\u2019s why it is extremely important that carriers\u2019 agents provide passengers with the most comprehensive carrier information related to baggage policies, that will apply to the entire ticketed itinerary. Baggage management considerations in interline In order to process baggage, carriers should establish policies and procedures to facilitate the handling of baggage in interline itineraries and reduce potential seams in their shared passenger\u2019s journey. Where the interline scenarios imply involvement of a 3rd party carrier or ground handler, these should be addressed and anticipated as well by the interline partners. Each airline shall ensure that all the internal teams know and abide by all applicable anti-trust regulations and limitations. When implementing a new interline partnership it is recommended that carriers discuss and clarify the following aspects with their partners: \u2022 Baggage policies and allowance \u2022 Baggage provision determination \u2022 Reservations and ticketing procedures \u2022 Excess baggage definition and limitations \u2022 Operational handling \u2022 Mishandled baggage \u2022 Reporting and Settlement of bag fees that are collected These aspects will be further detailed in the following sections of this document. 5  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Baggage policies and allowance Carriers should address whether baggage policies and procedures will vary depending on the type of connections (domestic or international), by airport or type of Ground Handler. Passengers\u2019 baggage allowance is generally based on a combination of rules for checked-in baggage and for carry-on baggage. The baggage allowance can be included in the passenger\u2019s fare, as an ancillary product, or as part of a program or membership. As each airline is responsible to determine its own baggage allowance and there are many different models for baggage entitlements it is important that interline partners are aware of, and plan for procedures when there are different policies on a single passenger itinerary. There are two standard checked-in free baggage allowance concepts: \u2022 Weight Concept: measured by the total weight of checked-in baggage, which is shown as a weight amount on the ticket (e.g. 20 kg or 45 lb). \u2022 Piece Concept (PC): measured by the number of pieces of checked-in baggage (shown as PC on the ticket). Some carrier policies combine these concepts part of their baggage allowance policy, such as 2 pieces not weighing more than 32KG in total or one piece allowed per passenger. In case of free/discounted allowance (included in the fare to be paid), IATA Recommended Practice 1788 \u2013 Ticketing and baggage regulations for free and reduced transportation, outlines the considerations carriers need to take into account for both reservation and ticketing procedures. Member airlines of the ZED-MIBA Forum programs have established baseline provisions for baggage allowance. In case of included and chargeable baggage allowances, it is recommended that carriers disclose their individual allowance via ATPCO. Many airline systems incorporate details from ATPCo\u2019s database, especially when determining the applicable charges for excess items or oversize/overweight items. The database has also critical information about items that may be embargoed (notably oversized special items on smaller aircraft types). Baggage provisions In interline itineraries, carriers shall ensure and be clear which carrier\u2019s baggage provisions apply in any circumstances. Whatever baggage provisions apply, this must be clear to the customer, and clear to the Operating Carrier and/or Ground Handler systems and the teams in the airport environment. 6  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards In the current environment, a single set of baggage provisions applies to an entire itinerary. The provisions that will apply are either selected following regulations, following the industry default selection provisions (IATA Resolution 302), or are selected by bilateral agreement. The main standard processes that currently determine the application of baggage provisions for interline journeys are: \u2022 IATA Resolution 302 determining which rules to apply in an interline journey, for each checked portion and defining the concept of the Most Significant Carrier (MSC). \u2022 US Rule for travel originating in or with the destination to either USA (U.S. DOT Regulation 399.87) or Canada (CTA Order 2014-A-158). The Governments of these nations require that a different concept applies. This concept states that the provisions of the Marketing Airline on the first coupon of the overall ticket shall apply to all flights on that ticket. Determining the Most Significant Carrier (MSC) The process to determine the Most Significant Carrier (MSC) is defined in IATA Resolution 302. In case of code-share flights, in general the Marketing Carrier's baggage policy prevails, unless that carrier publishes a rule stipulating that the Operating Carrier\u2019s baggage policy should apply. The general rules to determine the MSC are based on the Areas where the transportation takes place. These areas are categorized between the IATA Traffic Conference (TC) Areas and Sub-Areas as follows: \u2022 Traffic Conference Area 1 (TC1): The Western Hemisphere (The Americas and The Caribbean) \u2022 Traffic Conference Area 2 (TC2): Europe, Middle East and Africa \u2022 Traffic Conference Area 3 (TC3): Asia and Asia Pacific Based on the above categorization the MSC is: \u2022 The carrier performing carriage on the first sector that crosses from one Area to another for travel between two or more Tariff Conference (TC) Areas o Exception: TC123 only, the carrier providing carriage on the first sector that crosses between TC1 and TC2. \u2022 The carrier performing carriage on the first sector that crosses from one Sub-Area to another for travel between two or more Tariff Conference (TC) Sub-Areas \u2022 The carrier performing carriage on the first international sector for travel within a Tariff Conference (TC) Sub-Area. More information on this resolution can be found in the IATA Passenger Tariff Coordinating Conferences Resolutions Manual. 7  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Determination of Baggage Provisions To determine which rules to apply in an interline journey, for each checked in portion, the following standard process should be applied per IATA Resolution 302: \u2022 Step 1: In case the published baggage rules are the same amongst all carriers in an itinerary, then the same baggage rules should apply. \u2022 Step 2: In case one or more published baggage rules differ between carriers in an itinerary, then the published baggage provision of the MSC should apply. o In case of code-share flights the Marketing Carrier rule is applied unless the Marketing Carrier's published rules stipulate the use of the Operating Carrier rules. \u2022 Step 3: In case the MSC does not publish baggage rules for the journey, then the rules of the check-in carrier should apply. \u2022 Step 4: In case the check-in carrier does not publish baggage rules for the interline journey, then the rules of each Operating Carrier should apply, sector-by-sector. Additionally, when transporting baggage across carriers if additional charges need to be collected (e.g. chargeable baggage, excess baggage, etc.) the currency aspects shall also be considered and carriers should follow the recommendations described in the IATA Resolution 024a \u2013 Establishing passenger fares and related charges and IATA Resolution 024d \u2013 Currency names, codes, rounding units and acceptability of currencies. Reservation and ticketing procedures When a Passenger Name Record (PNR) is created or modified it is important to determine the baggage provisions that will apply for the selected itinerary. Many systems have the capability to determine the applicable baggage allowance when the PNR is created or modified in accordance to the existing standards and processes, either by including these entitlements in the reservation, or by referencing the tariffs that apply to the reservation. However, where there are no specific airline requirements and the systems do not provide the allowance, it is the responsibility of the agent making the reservation to determine the baggage allowance and advise the customer(s) accordingly. This is subject to auditing and revenue controls and airlines can raise an Agency Debit Memo (ADM) in case the agent does not follow the airline instruction. In general, the applicable free baggage allowance is included in the fare to be paid and would apply to any passenger who purchased this fare. Any additional entitlements granted to a passenger by virtue of their Frequent Flyer status, membership, corporate agreement, etc. would not apply, unless agreed bi-laterally between carriers. 8  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards The information about the passenger's baggage allowance and the carrier whose provisions have been selected may have been further stored in the passenger's e-ticket record, and may be exchanged in the standard ticketing messages to ensure visibility on the passenger\u2019s ticket record at any touch point. It is important that carriers ensure that there is enough information to determine baggage entitlements, which may also be achieved by filing fares with a service such as ATPCO. The baggage allowance of the ticket requires only the most basic information to be present, such as 20K, 30K, or 2PC. When the fare does not permit any free baggage allowance, \u2018NO\u2019, \u2018NIL\u2019 or \u2018XX\u2019 shall be entered in the baggage allowance. More details on how to store baggage information such as allowance and chargeable amounts in the e-ticket, can be found in the IATA Resolution 722, Chapter 18 - Baggage. The information in the e-ticket is further made available to the Departure Control System (DCS) and allows airport agents to process the interline passenger at check-in when accepting baggage. With this information, a DCS will determine if additional fees should be collected for checked-in bags in excess of the entitled allowance. In the current environment it is recommended that carriers\u2019 part of the interline itinerary exchange baggage data in electronic ticketing standard messages. These standard messages allow carriers to include and exchange various baggage related information such as the information on the maximum free baggage allowance weight via the \u201cMaximum Free baggage Weight\u201d data element (e.g. when the baggage allowance is based on pieces carriers can include as well the baggage weight followed by kilos \u2018K\u2019 or pounds \u2018L\u2019, e.g. 23K or 50L) or dimension via \u201cMaximum Free Baggage Dimensions\u201d data element (e.g. when the baggage allowance is based on pieces can include as well the maximum linear dimensions of the baggage followed by centimeters \u2018C\u2019 or inches \u2018I\u2019). In case the customer requests to transport other types of baggage services in addition to the default baggage allowance (such as bulky baggage, fragile baggage, courier baggage or bicycles) a notification should be sent to the other carriers participating in the interline itinerary. In general, a Special Service Request (SSR), with a dedicated service code, will be created in the PNR to capture this service. In interline itineraries the booking source should use the applicable booking method of each carrier and the service should be requested in separate transaction to each of the carrier part of the itinerary. Consequently, the carrying airline should reply to the booking agent with either a confirmation or rejection of the request and it is recommended that an agent should not assume that a message has been received or actioned without this confirmation. More details about the procedures carriers should follow from a reservation perspective for excess baggage, bulky baggage, fragile baggage, cabin baggage, courier baggage and bicycles, can be found in the the Recommended Practice 1790c, A4A/IATA Reservation Interline Message Procedures (AIRIMP) Chapter 3.21.3 and Reservations Handbook (RHB) Chapter 15.4 \u2013 Exceptional baggage. 9  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards At the time the customer\u2019s booking is confirmed, it is also critical that baggage related information is clearly disclosed, as it will be applied during the journey. This should include the baggage allowance that is included at no additional cost, baggage allowance that has been purchased separately, the ability to purchase additional checked-baggage either before travel or at time of check-in, any charges that will apply for excess baggage, and any limitations on cabin baggage. There are certain cases where a more detailed explanation of the baggage allowances and policies must be provided to the customer and the most common procedure is to include this information in plain text on the passenger itinerary receipt. If such information is not present on the receipt, carriers shall address and agree on best practices to ensure passing on the fullest information to the customer, based on the information usually present in the pricing and ticketing system. Excess baggage The purchase of additional baggage and the collection of excess baggage may create different challenges especially in interline scenario. Industry standards such as Electronic Miscellaneous Documents (EMDs) provide a mechanism to facilitate these processes using accountable documents and an interline settlement process, however these processes need to be agreed and implemented between carriers Carriers may also bilaterally establish a mechanism by which it can be recorded that an additional bag has been purchased. This should allow that this baggage is recognized in the airport environment and establish a process for billing value associated with the purchase of additional baggage if they choose to. From a reservation perspective, in the traditional distribution environment, the reservation agent should create an SSR Excess Baggage (XBAG) in the PNR to notify the other airlines participating in the itinerary when a customer wishes to take a considerable amount of excess baggage on a flight. Example: SSR XBAG CC NN/AMSGVA 0345M15NOV.5PIECES EACH30\u00d725\u00d715CM TOTL85KG When baggage related charges need to be collected on an accountable document, such as an EMD - A, the standard recommended Reason For Issuance Code (RFIC) to be used by carriers is \u2018C\u2019 - Baggage. This EMD-A will then be lifted with the associated ticket coupon. More detailed scenarios on chargeable baggage related services can be found in the Reservation Handbook, Chapter 26 and the specific reservation message formats to be used are described in the A4A/IATA Reservation Interline Message Procedures (AIRIMP) in Chapter 3.21.3 Baggage related services. 10  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Different examples of the process and the image of EMDs when collecting baggage charges are available in the Ticketing Handbook (THB) Chapter 3.8.2 - Baggage. An Interline EMD Baggage Implementation Guide have been published by IATA and this document outlines the recommended end-to-end usage of the Associated Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD-A) standards specific to the use of EMDs in relation to baggage. The specifications and examples included in this Guide are intended to facilitate the proper issuance, collection, refund, and processing of EMD-A for baggage, but are not exhaustive. Carriers should bilaterally agree on the set of data and messages to be exchanged in case of excess baggage. The IATA template for the Interline Electronic Miscellaneous Documents and Additional/Optional Services General Business Requirements (EMD GBR) can be used by the interline partners to check and agree on the technical settings of each party. Paper Excess Baggage Tickets IATA Member airlines have (since 2015) endorsed removal of paper traffic documents, with only one exception: for excess baggage until 31 May 2021. This exception, and the allowance to use Excess Baggage Tickets, is for carriers who wish to interline excess baggage charges and who do not have interline EMD capability. In this case carriers should bilaterally discuss and agree with each of their partners to any exceptions on the listed standards recommendations, and they should ensure that any administrative procedures are understood by each airline. 11  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Operational Handling The generic operational flow of the checked-in baggage, from the acceptance of the baggage through to the return of the baggage to the passenger is illustrated in the following diagram: Figure 1: Operational baggage flow The operational procedures that carriers should follow when forming an interline partnership are outlined in the Resolution 780 Form of Interline Traffic Agreement \u2013 Passenger including Baggage. 8.1 Checked-in baggage Checked-in baggage is a baggage for which the carrier takes custody and issues, validates or updates a baggage tag. Checked-in baggage is transported in the hold of the aircraft on which the passenger is travelling but remains inaccessible for the passenger during the flight. 12  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Resolution 780 stipulates the procedures which shall be used for the Interline carriage of passenger\u2019s baggage, where the passenger\u2019s journey on one ticket (including conjunction tickets) involves connecting transportation on two or more flights. From an operational standpoint, a connection between two scheduled flights is defined when the delivering carrier\u2019s flight is scheduled to arrive at the connecting point and the receiving carrier\u2019s flight is schedule to depart from the connecting point on the same day or on the next day within 12 hours. It also implies that the delivering carrier has clarified with the passenger to have the baggage checked through. The operator may refuse to carry checked-in baggage if this baggage: \u2022 is likely to endanger the aircraft or persons or property on board the aircraft \u2022 is inadequately packed or unsuitable for air carriage due to its weight, size or nature or forbidden by law, regulations, security standards or safety standards of any state to be flown from, to or over1. The baggage of a passenger registered for an international departure flight but who has failed to board that flight, cannot be placed or kept on board the aircraft (Baggage Reconciliation). Such a baggage should be subject to security control as detailed in the Positive Passenger Baggage Matching covered in IATA Recommended Practice (RP) 1739. 8.2 Baggage Acceptance Prior to the transportation of interline baggage it is recommended that the originating carrier: \u2022 Ensure the baggage is adequately secured to permit safe transportation with ordinary care. If the baggage has no family name and initials, the passenger shall affix such exterior identification to the baggage prior to acceptance; \u2022 Issue for each piece of baggage an interline baggage tag that complies with industry standards IATA Resolution 740 and RP1740a; \u2022 Draw passenger's attention to the baggage identification tag(s) and in particular to the destination where they need to collect their bag upon returning the baggage identification tag(s) to the passenger. The ten-digit license plate on the tag uses the Baggage Tag Issuer Code (BTIC) of the originating carrier who accepted the baggage and issued the bag tag. For codeshare flights, in order to ensure the interline bag is transferred correctly, the tag itself must bear the flight designator (airline designator and flight number) of the operating flight. The BTIC, according to IATA Resolution 769 must be registered and usable in other systems (such as airports, other airlines, etc.) 1 Reference: Special Handling Processes: i.e. live animals, dangerous goods, firearms etc. as covered in Resolutions 745, 745a, 745b and IATA Live Animals Regulations 13  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards In the event that passengers must collect their checked-in baggage at any point before their final destination (such as a transfer point), they must be clearly informed of this, and what actions are required to re-check the baggage with the next carrier in the journey service, especially if it will require leaving the sterile \u201cairside\u201d environment and requiring security screening. Subject to Operating Airline policy, of each airline involved in the carriage of the baggage, the baggage can be checked-in and labelled to one of the following points, whichever occurs first: \u2022 The next stopover point for the passenger \u2022 The point to which transportation has been confirmed (where coupon status is OK), requested (where coupon status is RQ) or listed (where coupon status is SA). \u2022 The point where a change of airport is involved \u2022 The final destination specified in the ticket, including any tickets issued in conjunction with the original ticket. In addition, carriers shall address and consider the following needs: \u2022 The Minimum Connecting Time (MCT) shall be respected, and adjustments to airport default MCTs should ensure that bags can be reliably transferred between arriving and departing flights \u2022 Unless subject to specific agreement between airlines, through check-in baggage on separate tickets is prohibited. Following the IATA Resolution 754 (Profile 10 - Through Check-in\u2014No Interline Agreement between Carriers), when the originating carrier accepts baggage for through check-in and no interline agreement exists between the carriers, it will be considered as a fault in the baggage prorate process, and will result in 100% prorate of the mishandling expense to the carrier who checked in the bag. Through check-in on separate tickets and without any additional agreement in place increases the risk of baggage being mishandled at the transfer point, leading thus to a risk and negative customer experience when handling passenger\u2019s baggage. If allowed by the Operating Airline policies, the baggage may be labelled to a transfer destination on the ticket. Specific rules of the Operating Airline apply for special types of baggage, such as Live Animals (AVIH), and there may be additional rules or restrictions imposed by local regulation or the aircraft types in use. 14  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Examples: Through Case Remarks/Actions for airline or ground handling staff labelling Customs clearance Yes Advise passenger to pick up baggage at the transfer point. required at the Refer to TIM/TIMATIC for country rules. transfer point The passenger No Inform the passenger about the risk of missing the specifically wants the connecting flight. baggage at a transfer point Animals Vivant In Hold Yes Only permitted if the continuing carrier has confirmed (AVIH) acceptance. Within permissible MCT. When passengers must collect their hold baggage during the transfer process (for example because of immigration or security policies of a State), the airline or its contracted Ground Handler should treat hold baggage as originating baggage. If the baggage is collected at landside, it might need to be submitted to screening before  it on the aircraft. Interline transfer and connecting baggage must follow the reconciliation procedures as originating baggage as per Operating Carrier policy and national regulations. 8.3 Baggage Carriage It is recommended that interline and online connecting baggage shall be separated from other baggage, mail and cargo on all aircraft arriving non-stop or with one-stop already from the Point of Origin. MITA-P Article 3.5.2 requires that when it becomes necessary to leave the baggage behind due to payload/weight restrictions, each party of the agreement shall give  priority to transferring interline baggage. A best practice for baggage destined for a short connection is to identify it with a remark on the baggage tag, a separate short connection tag or sticker, or as an attribute in an electronic bag identification and tagging system. At each airport, IATA procedures in Resolution 744 guide the establishment and practices of a Local Baggage Committee. This includes senior representatives of the scheduled passenger airlines operating regularly in that location, that work to ensure the timely and accurate transfer of interline bags. One important responsibility of the Local Baggage Committee is to establish the default minimum connecting time requirements at the concerned airport. IATA Resolutions 744 and 765, along with IATA RP 1744, describe this process as well as the procedures for exceptions that may be needed. It is the responsibility of the delivering airline to transfer and deliver the baggage to the next receiving airline at the location and hours based on the agreement between the concerned parties (e.g. Agreed 15  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Transfer Point as per the Service Level Agreement or the Standard Ground Handling Agreement). It should not be assumed that an airline will be able to receive interline baggage without prior arrangement or notification. Even with standards agreed and supported at key airports where interline transfers take place it is crucial that the Local Baggage teams agree on how bags will be moved, how often, how fast and who will handle each step according to the local procedures as agreed. In the event of customs clearance or government imposed security measures at an intermediate point en route of a transfer journey, when the passenger is requested to be physically present with the bag, the delivering airline shall be responsible for informing the passenger, preferably immediately after dis- embarkment. In case the agent involved with the re-check-in process notices a mistake or a problem (e.g. the departure is delayed or cancelled, the bag tag reflects an incorrect flight number), they should address that before sending the bag through. When passengers have been involuntarily rerouted (typically after a delay or cancellation), Interline partners should minimize the impact of the inconvenience by efficiently rerouting the passenger\u2019s checked baggage. 8.4 Wheelchairs and mobility aids Wheelchairs and Mobility Aids are crucial to their passenger owners, and thus must be treated with special care. Mobility devices such as wheelchairs, rolling walkers or swiss tracks operated with manual or electric power must be handled accordingly. There are specific rules and concerns when handling such aids, especially when they have batteries that also need special handling. Battery- powered wheelchairs (usually captured in the PNR using the following SSR codes: SSR WCBD, SSR WCBW) cannot be interlined according to the IATA Resolution 745b. 8.5 Cabin baggage Cabin baggage is carried and stowed in the cabin under passengers\u2019 control and custody. It is also commonly referred to as hand baggage, carry-on baggage or unchecked cabin baggage. Each carrier sets its standards for the size, weight and number of pieces permitted as cabin baggage. In the event that carry-on baggage entitlements vary between carriers, i.e. is prohibited, or is payable, it should be understood between carriers and address the impact to an interline passenger during the journey. Cabin baggage includes: 16  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards \u2022 Cabin baggage carried within the Operating Carrier free carry-on baggage allowance \u2022 Free carry-on items permitted by the Operating Carrier in addition to the standard allowance (e.g. purse, laptop, duty free item, winter coats, etc.) \u2022 Special items permitted by the Operating Carrier that may require prior arrangement, notification and/or specialized screening or additional charges (e.g., urns containing human remains, pets, medical equipment and valuables, etc.) The maximum size and weight for carry-on baggage items are established by the operating airline. These dimensions include wheels, handles, side pockets, etc. Any item exceeding these dimensions may not be accepted as carry-on baggage. Following the IATA Recommended Practice 1749, carriers shall publish a maximum carry-on baggage allowance applicable to their aircraft fleet. Such allowances may vary from carrier to carrier and by classes of service. Therefore, when interline carriage is involved, the passenger should be informed of the allowances of all the carriers in their itinerary to determine if their baggage is acceptable (e.g. between long haul and short haul flights). Cabin baggage can only be accepted if: \u2022 It is suitable and compliant with the air transportation policies for weight, size and nature \u2022 Can fit under the seat or be stowed in the overhead compartment \u2022 Is suitably packed \u2022 Conforms with airport security and safety policies. Restrictions shall apply: \u2022 In case of certain items because of their weight, size or nature can only be accepted with the consent of the Operator (e.g. musical instruments, etc.) \u2022 For security reasons, as many countries restrict the carriage of liquids, aerosols and gels in hand baggage \u2022 To items refused by security screening which must be hold-checked as per the Operating Airline policies \u2022 In addition to airline policies, for Dangerous Goods items. The items permitted/excluded from cabin baggage must be checked against the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) Manual. 8.6 Baggage Messaging in the operational environment After each flight departure, details of interline baggage transfers are sent using Baggage Transfer Messages (BTMs) as outlined in the IATA Resolution 709. 17  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards When carriers form new interline partnerships an important aspect to be considered is the impact and the cases where in specific airports the used Departure Control System (DCS) is different than the carrier\u2019s one (e.g. Ground Handler DCS). Those stations will have to comply with the expectations of the carrier downline interline partner. The BTMs process often requires that each new interline relationship is also supported in the DCS used by each carrier or the carrier\u2019s Ground Handler. Any exceptions of this should be discussed and agreed between carriers. The recommended procedures that airlines should follow and implement around the exchange of BTMs are described in the IATA Recommended Practice 1745. The bar code on the baggage tag references the ten-digits bag tag number (not the flight details on the tag). That tag number is then linked with the tag\u2019s details in Baggage Information Messages (BIMs). According to IATA RP 1745, a variety of other BIMs are used to communicate between and among airline and airport systems to ensure prompt and accurate handling of airline\u2019s flights. Following the IATA Resolution 753 it is mandatory to scan the interline baggage at four key points: \u2022 at check-in, when loaded on the originating flight \u2022 at the agreed transfer point (when the custody of the baggage changes) \u2022 at handover to the downline connecting flight, airline or its handler \u2022 upon arrival (typically at arrivals inject). IATA Resolution 755 covers the rules and messaging for re-flighting into interline carriers. Additional local regulations may apply, such as Bag Scanning in the United States. Reporting and Settlement Interline Baggage Proration When forming a new interline partnership, carriers should ensure clear understanding on the impact of documents used to collect additional baggage fees how those are will be billed and settled. If EMDs or excess baggage tickets have been agreed to be used, then carriers should ensure that the proration method is agreed and understood by each airline. If the carriers bilaterally agree not to prorate baggage charges, or not to bill, they should ensure that the appropriate administrative procedures for back-office settlement are in place and understood by each carrier. According to the Multilateral Proration Agreement Prorate (MPA-P) provisions if baggage fees or optional services fees are collected and an interlineable document (EMD) is issued, then such fees will 18  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards be prorated using Straight Rate Proration (SRP) methodology. SRP is the proportional division of the through fare or excess baggage charge across the entire interline journey. Where the baggage fees are included in the sector fee(s) or fare components, no specific proration on these will be performed. Interline Billing and Settlement In the existing distribution environment, and specifically for carriers operating under MITA concurrences, carriers who operate services bill the issuing carrier after services have been delivered. As general rules, billing occurs under the standards established in the Revenue Accounting Manual (RAM), invoicing occurs through the Simplified Industry Settlement (SIS) platform, and settlement occurs through the IATA Clearing House (ICH). The Revenue Accounting Manual also contains information on how to manage the dispute processes. When forming a new interline partnership, carriers should establish if any interline billing procedures beyond those established in IATA standards are needed. The interline settlement rules for excess baggage are outlined in the Revenue Accounting Manual (RAM) Chapter A2 as following RAM Chapter A2 Paragraph 1.1.4: The airline issuing the ticket is responsible for the correct completion of the free baggage allowance box. The actual carrier is entitled to assume that the free baggage allowance inserted on each coupon, even when varying excess baggage allowances are applicable, is correct and may compute its charges to the passenger accordingly. If an under- collection is discovered later because of an incorrect free baggage allowance entry the actual carrier may debit the issuing airline for its loss of revenue RAM Chapter A2 Paragraph 1.7, Billing Excess Baggage Charges: In respect of excess baggage charges billed on documents issued under the application of IATA Resolution 302, the issuing airline is responsible to the carrying airline for the full appropriate rate determined by the baggage provisions selection criteria of the resolution. If such a rate is not available, settlement shall be based on the filed carrier rule for the journey for which the flight coupon(s) was/were issued. If, for whatever reason, the issuing airline has made an under or over collection, it must absorb any resulting difference between the collected and applicable amounts. In case of incomplete routing, billing must be in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Revenue Accounting Manual Chapter A2. According to this, where a flight coupon shows incomplete or contradictory information for the calculation of the amounts to be billed the billing airline is entitled to bill an amount not exceeding the applicable excess baggage charge for the sector(s) billed. 19  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards In order to avoid interline disputes it is recommended that carriers address and discuss from the beginning their functional and technical capabilities in applying the IATA Resolution 302 to identify whose baggage rules apply. For the interline invoicing that occurs through the Simplified Industry Settlement (SIS), RAM Passenger Source code 23 (EMD Billings) should apply for EMD issued for excess baggage while the RAM Passenger Source Code 25 (Excess Baggage Coupon Billings) refers to paper excess baggage documents. According to RAM Chapter A2 Paragraph 1.2.2.1: The issuing airline may reject any item billed under this sub-paragraph with the difference between the correct fare or excess baggage charge (or prorate thereof) and the amount billed only if the difference is more than USD30 gross or its equivalent. The minimum requirement of USD30 does not apply, if the issuing airline is able to prove that when issued, the ticket concerned was complete and not contradictory. The issuing airline must support its rejection with full details, i.e. a computer-generated image to show routing, carrying airlines and fare calculation points, of the basis on which the fare or excess baggage charge (and prorate) has been established. Mishandled baggage Operational considerations Regardless of the reason of baggage mishandling, it is important that interline carriers continue to focus and deliver an excellent customer service by providing prompt, efficient and caring efforts to reunite the passenger with his/ her missing baggage. The carrier on which the passenger travelled to the point of stopover or final destination where the baggage is missing, is responsible for raising a file, tracing and tracking the missing baggage in order to deliver it back to the passenger. Nevertheless, at the request of the passenger, any carrier involved in the interline passenger journey should start the tracing process and then notify the carrier to whom the loss will be or was originally reported. When a passenger reports the missing baggage at the connecting point where he/she is required to submit through checked-in baggage for customs clearance or government-imposed security check, the delivering carrier shall be responsible for: \u2022 Immediately initiating tracing for the missing baggage in accordance with the agreed procedures, provided that there is sufficient time to obtain and record the baggage and flight data required for tracing; and \u2022 Informing the carrier with whom the passenger travels to the final destination (and which remains responsible for accepting and resolving the customer\u2019s report) of: o the baggage missing already at the connecting point o the tracing initiated and its results 20  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards o the arrangements for forwarding the missing baggage to that airline for further delivery to the passenger. When it\u2019s necessary to search for missing baggage, the IATA Resolution743 and IATA RP1743a provide a useful framework for these processes. Currently, most airlines either use SITA\u2019s WorldTracer\u00ae or a compatible system that is authorized to interface with WorldTracer. When the destination to which the baggage is to be delivered is on the routing shown on the ticket, each carrier should transport the baggage without charge in accordance with such routing. When the destination to which the baggage needs to be delivered is not on the routing shown on the ticket, the baggage shall be forwarded to the nearest airport point at the expense of the airline responsible for the mishandling. Mishandled baggage (also known as RUSH baggage) shall be forwarded without charge by the fastest possible means using the services of any airline member, to the airport nearest to the passenger's address. Forwarding of such expedite baggage should not be restricted nor delayed at an interline connecting point for security reasons provided it has been screened. Some governments may require members to impose additional security controls. An automated and printed on demand form of label (IATA Resolution 740) is used by many carriers, and a unique coding assigned to the RUSH tag permits it to be identified by scanning systems. Carriers do not always accept each other\u2019s RUSH baggage. Where carriers do not accept RUSH baggage then different rules may be followed such as expediting mishandling bags via flights of alliance partners. RUSH bags might not be accepted for carriage because of weight and other operational restrictions (e.g. the size of aircraft). An airline that participates in the carriage of baggage at the request of another airline (meaning carrying already mishandled baggage), should not be held liable for any loss, damage or delay that might occur, provided the participating airline was not involved in the original mishandling. At the destination airport the expedite baggage shall be delivered to the passenger: \u2022 by the airline on whose flight the passenger had travelled to the final destination or point of stopover; or \u2022 in case the airline is not represented at the final destination or point of stopover, by any IATA Member, preferably by the Member on whose flight the expedite baggage arrived at such airport. 21  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Claiming and settlement of mishandled baggage Legal times for reporting cases of mishandling (delay, damage, pilferage, lost) are covered in the Montreal Convention, as well as the maximum limits for claim for lost or damaged baggage. An airline receiving a baggage claim, and having participated in the carriage of the passenger, will process the claim to a conclusion, with the passenger, in accordance with the law of the country of settlement and airline\u2019s internal policies. The tariff/policy of the claim-settling carrier will be applied to all baggage claim settlements. This covers interim expense policy, exclusions and liabilities. Such settlement will then be reimbursed to the settling carrier as follows: \u2022 When it is established in which airline's custody the mishandling (meaning damage, delay, loss, or pilferage) occurred, that airline accepts the claim settlement arising from such mishandling as incurred by the settling carrier. \u2022 When it is not established which airline is responsible, each carrying airline that participated in the carriage of the passenger shall share the claim settlement on the basis of the flown mileage between all ticketed points of each carrying airline. \u2022 Reason for loss codes and fault stations are for in house use only, they do not constitute proof of error in proration claims and delivery charges. Within sixty days of the date of payment the claim receiving airline will send a prorate request to the other participating or responsible airline(s) at their baggage prorate office, providing them with relevant claim settlement documents. The IATA currency exchange rate on the date of flight should be applied in the calculation of the amount to prorate. No additional administration fees are subject of the request of payment sent by the claim receiving airline. When any type of marketing/commercial, partner, or code share agreement exists, the prorate request will be sent to the Operating Carrier (if it is an IATA carrier and thus subject to proration). The Operating and Marketing Carrier may re-charge each other depending on their established agreements. If a prorate notice is not given on time by the carrier receiving the claim, future acceptance of a similar notice will remain at the discretion of the participating or responsible airline(s). The list of the mandatory documents requested to be provided for a prorate request are outlined in the IATA Resolution 780 (including information such as the passenger ticket number, a copy of the baggage tag, a copy of the claim prepared by the passenger, etc. ). 22  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards The list of agreed settlements in the form of amounts payable by responsible airline(s) shall not be uploaded into the IATA Clearing House (ICH) to action the payment(s) until an agreement between the respective baggage prorate offices of the participating airline(s) has been made. The upload must have attached the: \u2022 Baggage Tracing System reference number(s) \u2022 Date of Flight(s) and \u2022 Agreement of acceptance between the respective baggage prorate offices. In the event the participating or responsible airline(s) do not respond within sixty days from the date of the request for payment and in order to action the proration of such claim, a proof of the initial request or claim settlement sent by the claim receiving airline may be uploaded in lieu of the agreement of acceptance. In case the airline receiving the claim uses transportation in lieu of cash to settle the total claim, the airline should not request proration settlement from any other airline. If the airline receiving the claim uses transportation in lieu of cash to settle a portion of the claim, such airline should bill the other claim participating airline(s) its prorated share of the amount of the settlement not covered by transportation in lieu of cash. There are some agreements on baggage prorating that might exist between airlines, stating that airlines might not prorate each other if they are within the same alliance. There is no prorating on delivery expenses. Delivery costs from the airport to the passenger may be recharged by the delivering carrier (not the delivering vendor) to the airline responsible for the mishandling. The amount recharged shall be supported by proof of the cost incurred either by the file reference (to allow the receiving airline to check the baggage tracing system files using the available transactions within the system) or, if there is no compatible system being used, and/or a non-IATA Carrier, by a copy of the file report. 23  IATA 2020 Guidance Document for Airlines Interline Considerations on Baggage Standards Appendix Area Corresponding Resolutions and Recommended Practices Baggage Provisions IATA Resolution 302 \u2013 Baggage Provision Selection Criteria IATA Recommended Practice 1788 \u2013 Ticketing and baggage regulations for free and reduced transportation Baggage Reservation A4A/IATA Reservation Interline Message Procedures (AIRIMP) Recommended Practice 1790c- Chargeable Baggage Related Service Baggage Ticketing IATA Resolution 722 \u2013 Ticket General Procedures and Definitions IATA Resolution 722 \u2013 Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) - General Procedures and Definitions Baggage Operational IATA Resolution 780 \u2013 Form of Interline Traffic Agreement IATA handling Resolution 740 \u2013 Form of Interline Baggage Tag IATA Resolution 769 \u2013 Baggage Tag Issuer Codes IATA Resolution 754 \u2013 Profiles of Interline Baggage Claims and Proof of Fault for Baggage Prorates IATA Resolution 765 \u2013 Interline Connecting Time Intervals IATA Resolution 743 \u2013 Found and unclaimed checked baggage IATA Recommended Practice 1739 \u2013 Passenger/Baggage Reconciliation Procedures IATA Recommended Practice 1744 \u2013 Local Baggage Committee Bylaws,  of Reference and Operating Rules IATA Recommended Practice 1749 \u2013 Carriage of Carry-on Baggage Reporting and Settlement Revenue Accounting Manual (RAM) Other tools and utilities Electronic Miscellaneous Available in the Standard Setting Workspace under the IATA Document (EMD) model General Ticketing Group page on the Standard Setting Workspace.

The Working Group analysed this draft, discussed it with IATA and reported back to the Working Party. In consequence, IATA submitted revised versions, which were again analysed and discussed. After IATA decided that it could not further modify the draft in view of its acceptance by its members, the IATA Passenger Service Conference adopted RP 1774 in October 20004. 1 Official Journal no. L 281 of 23/11/1995, p. 31, available at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/dataprot/index.htm 2 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, JO L 281, 23 November 1995, p. 31. Available at http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/Internal_market/en/index.htm 3 At the same meeting, the Working Party adopted the document (WP 13 (504/98)) \u201cFuture work on codes of conduct: Working document on the procedure for the consideration by the Working Party of Community code of conduct\u201d, adopted on 10 September 1998, available at: see footnote 1. 4 See Annex I (and/or website of IATA etc) 2 The present document, prepared by the Working Group, reflects the view of the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party on RP 1774 as adopted by IATA. Recommended Practice 1774 RP 1774 is a recommendation adopted by IATA Members within the forum of the Passenger Services Conference and as such, only commits IATA Members. In particular, RP 1774 is not concerned with the obligations of Computer Reservation Systems and travel agents, which are covered by the new \u201cCouncil Regulation 323/1999 of 8 February 1999 amending Regulation N\u00b0 2299/89 on a code of conduct for computer reservation systems (CRSs)\u201d. A Recommended Practice is, by its very nature, not binding and there is no compliance mechanism in place. However, it should be clearly understood that all IATA Resolutions and Recommended Practices are not imposed by the IATA Secretariat but are adopted on a voluntary basis by the IATA Membership in the democratic fora of the Conferences. A Recommended Practice is in many instances only a suggested framework that individual members adapt to comply with their national requirements and according to their own individual commercial practices. A good analogy is RP 1724 \u201c of Carriage\u201d. Some carriers have adopted these  as such, without modification, but many others have used them as a model and have adapted them to their individual regulatory and commercial environment. Similarly, RP 1774 will be presented to and for adoption by IATA airlines (through the forum of Passenger Service Conference) but each airline will remain free to create its own code of conduct vis-\u00e0-vis its own customers, and in accordance with national legal and regulatory requirements. Also for evident antitrust immunity reasons IATA must avoid imposing any commercial behaviour on its members. In view of the above, RP 1774 is not intended to be the final code of conduct for use as such by IATA Member airlines. It is rather designated to highlight some main aspects of the Data Protection Directive and to be used as a guideline by Member airlines (or a group of Member airlines) when preparing a code of conduct to be presented to the data protection authorities concerned. Other points (e.g. detailed description of the individual Member\u2019s use of data, compliance procedures etc.) will have to be addressed by each Member airline (or group of Member airlines) on an ad hoc basis, in compliance with applicable national laws and regulations, and taking into account the specific cultural environment, commercial practices and service orientation. The latest version of RP 1774 addresses in three Articles definitions (Article 1), scope (Article 2) and principles (Article 3) on data quality, information, right of access, special categories of data, notification to supervisory authorities, data security and transfers to third countries. Article 1 - Definitions The definitions are now aligned on the  of Directive 95/46/EC. 3 Article 2 - Scope Article 2 on scope clarifies that Members have to comply with national laws and, if the laws require more, to apply more stringent or additional measures. Article 3 - Data quality The principle of data quality has been improved compared to the initial version in the sense that a list of purposes for which personal data are typically collected by airlines is indicated (Art. 3.1.2). Another improvement compared to the initial text is that the time limitation for storage of identifiable data has been included, though in a general way, and that a useful distinction is made between on-line archiving of reservations (only as long as necessary to provide the service) and off-line storage (if required by law), as proposed by the Working Group. However, this provision would have more significance if it provided more specific wording on the concrete application of the purpose limitation principle and the prohibition of incompatible use (Article 6 (1b) of Directive 95/46/EC). Article 3.3 of RP 1774 reiterates the wording of Art 10 of the directive, but without any specific examples. The Working Party considers that IATA could have recommended that information on the right of access be regarded as necessary to guarantee fair processing, and that this information be included on each ticket (see also below: reference to RP 1774 in resolution 724). Article 3.7 Transfers of data to third countries A clear improvement has been achieved by explaining the significance of international data transfers for the provision of airline services. The Working Party recalls the Commission decision, which declare that Switzerland, Hungary and the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d Arrangement in the United States provide for adequate protection5. Airline companies fall within the scope of the Decision on the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d, and should be encouraged to adhere to it. As regards transfers to other countries or other sectors than those covered by the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d Arrangement in the USA, IATA is of the opinion that transfers of personal data to third countries are necessary for the performance of the contract between the airline and the passenger and thus fall under the exemption of Article 26 (1) b of Directive 95/46/EC. IATA also considers that other possible derogations could provide the ground for the transfer, such as Article 26 (1) d (if the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims), or Article 26 (1) e (if the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject). According to IATA, these exemptions cover common situations in aviation and could be used as a basis for transfers to third countries. The wording in Article 3.7 of RP 1774 therefore leaves it to members to consider whether it is necessary to obtain the consent of the data subject in order to ensure fair processing. 5 See OJ L 215 of 25.8.2000 4 In its working document on transfers of personal data to third countries6, the Working Party had indicated that the exemption of Article 26 (1) b of Directive 95/46/EC could be applied to those transfers necessary to reserve an airline ticket for a passenger. However, as expressed in the same working document, it is necessary to clearly indicate the data that are actually necessary for the purpose of ticket reservation, to ensure that the data subject\u2019s contractual consent covers them, and that data are only processed (transferred) for such clearly specified purpose. The Working Party therefore recalls first that national law applicable to the controller must provide for the derogations mentioned in Article 26 paragraph 1, and second that their application is always submitted to the \u201cnecessity test\u201d (the transfer must be necessary to achieve a given objective, and that objective can not be achieved without the transfer). A careful case by case analysis must therefore be carried out for each of the derogations mentioned in Article 26 (1). The Working Party takes the view that Article 26 (1) e for example (transfer necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject) can be met only in very exceptional circumstances and that airline companies should not be misled as to the scope of this derogation. A clearer distinction between the cases referred to under Article 26 (1) of Directive 95/46/EC and explanation of the  under which they can serve as a basis for transfers in RP 1774 would have been useful. The Working Party would like to remind that contractual solutions can provide safeguards for the transfer of personal data in third countries without an adequate level of protection (see Article 26 (2) of Directive 95/46/EC). Standard contractual clauses offering sufficient safeguards will soon be issued by the European Commission as recommended by the Working Party and the Article 31 Committee (see Article 26 (4) of Directive 95/46/EC). IATA members should take into account the explanations given above when implementing RP 1774. Wide accessibility of reservation data The subgroup criticised the fact that all reservation data are accessible from any point in the world by IATA members. In this context, IATA explained the difference between baggage data and reservation data. Baggage data are only available after check-in to other carriers participating in the itinerary. In case of a lost baggage, information on his baggage is transmitted, on a voluntary basis by the passenger, to the baggage tracing systems. Another technical Recommended Practice lays down the procedure for tracing lost baggage.7 For reservation data, if a booking is taken by an airline it should be kept confidential by that airline. If the booking taken by airline A involves travel on airline B, airline A will send to airline B a teletype message, which contains a sub-set of reservation data. The data sent will include the name of the passenger, the flight booked on airline B and the preceding flight, together with any special requests. These data should be kept on-line 6 WP 12: Transfers of personal data to third countries: Applying Articles 25 and 26 of the EU Data Protection Directive (adopted on 24 July 1998). 7 RP 1743a - Tracing Procedure for Missing Checked Baggage 5 only as long as necessary to provide the service and only kept off-line of necessary for legal requirements (see above on Article 3 of RP 1774). IATA justified this system with the need that other airlines or other offices of the same airline need the data in case of change of flights. Though the Working Party understands the need for such system, it would like to recall that in situations where personal data including sensitive ones are accessible on a world-wide basis it is necessary to implement technical and organisational security measures aiming at preventing unauthorised access to and abuse of these data. Legitimacy of processing The Recommended Practice does not mention the legitimacy of processing (Art 7 of directive). The Working Party recalls that, insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the provision of a service, the processing would be legitimate under Article 7 b, where a contract has been concluded with the potential passenger. In the absence of such contract, the processing would only be legitimate if the individual has given his consent (Article 7 a) or if his interests and rights do not prevail (Article 7 f). No provision on enforcement RP 1774 does not provide for any enforcement mechanism. This had been criticised by the subgroup. IATA responded by explaining that IATA has no supervisory or other authoritative role vis-\u00e0-vis its members. IATA proposes guidelines and even in case IATA members adopt them under the IATA auspices, it is then up to each of them to decide whether and how (fully or partially) they implement them into their own business practice. IATA cannot exercise any coercive measure against members. However, members are responsible according to national laws applicable as well as on the basis of their contracts with the passengers. IATA therefore proposes to add a reference to the data protection guidelines into the guidelines on general  for carriage (see next part below). It may be useful to consider the possibility for  audits for those IATA members who implement RP 1774. Recommended Practice 1724 General  of Carriage (Passenger and Baggage) This recommended practice specifies the general  that each airline company shall, as a minimum, include in its general  for their contracts with the passenger. Alike all IATA recommended practices, it has the same hortatory value as RP 1774 on data protection. In practice each IATA member has its own  of carriage, which are mostly based on RP 1724. Therefore, by including a reference to RP 1774 on data protection into RP 1724, the probability that airline companies follow the recommended practice on data protection and  increases (though not guaranteed). In addition, by becoming part of the contract between the airline and the passenger, the question of enforcement receives at least a contractual answer: the carrier is liable for fair processing based on RP 1774 on the basis of the contract with the passenger. In addition, 6 as Article 2.2 of RP 1774 states, where national data protection laws exist, they are applicable and airline companies have to comply with these laws. The added value of IATA's proposal to include a reference to RP 1774 into RP 17248 thus consists in the contractual obligation for those airlines not falling under the scope of Directive 95/46/EC and which have integrated this provision. This is an important step forward and should be encouraged. At the same time, this inclusion would constitute a way to find out about the airline\u2019s data protection and  policy: most airlines base their own  of carriage on RP 1724 General  of Carriage which, upon revision, would include a reference to RP 1774 on data protection. The airline\u2019s condition of carriage is included by reference in its  of contract. By obtaining the text of the airline\u2019s  of carriage, the passenger can see the reference to the data protection and  policy of the airline and ask for the relevant text that, ideally, would follow RP 1774. However, this way of informing the passenger is less direct than another option that is explained in the paragraph below. Resolution 724 Ticket \u2013 Notice and  of Contract The inclusion of a reference to data  on the airline ticket was also discussed Resolution 724 Ticket-Notice and  of Contract lays down the elements that, at a minimum, shall be indicated in the ticket. If a reference to RP 1774 were included in this Resolution, the consequence would be that such information must be on the ticket itself. The passenger would thus have the possibility to find out directly by means of the ticket where to obtain information on whether the airline has a data protection and  policy and if so what is its content. The Working Party takes the view that this would represent a clear improvement in  of transparency and passenger protection, because a reference to the data  policy of the carrier would be included in all tickets. Since the adoption of a resolution requires unanimity of all IATA member airlines and in this case would represent a modification of all tickets, worldwide, IATA has indicated that this is not a realistic solution that may be achieved in the short term. IATA position In view of the above, IATA understood that RP 1774 would not qualify as a Community code of conduct in the sense of Article 27 (3) of Directive 95/46/EC. IATA therefore did not insist in getting a formal opinion in the sense of Article 27 (3) of Directive 95/46/EC. IATA however underlines the practical value of revised RP 1774, which, in its previous version, has already served for many years as guideline for its members. IATA is of the opinion that RP 1774 as now revised in light of Directive 95/46/EC and accepted by the Passenger Service Conference, constitutes an important point of reference for its members and a much more useful tool to foster the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data in the airline sector worldwide. IATA is therefore 8 The inclusion would be under Article 5.3 of RP 1724 which informs the passenger that by giving his personal data, he recognises that they can be used for the purposes mentioned there. The same purposes are further spelt out as examples in RP 1774 under Article 3.1 Quality of data. 7 committed to strongly invite its members to implement RP 1774 in their business rules and practices. IATA also considers taking further steps to ensure implementation of RP 1774. As proposed by the Working Group, a reference to RP 1774 could be made in the general  of carriage (Recommendation 1724) at the occasion of a revision of the latter. This reference would be a great step further in the sense that it would made the implementation of RP 1774 more likely, if IATA members follow the resolution 724 on contracts (they are not obliged since this Resolution also has a non-binding character, but all carriers have to have general  of contract and therefore look closely at this Resolution). It would also give strong visibility to RP 1774 because it would need to be mentioned on the tickets. In practice, all tickets would need to be modified. The modification of Resolution 724 requires unanimous approval by all 266 IATA members. Conclusions The Working Party welcomes the initiative of IATA and its commitment to lay down common principles for its members with a view to ensuring the protection of the fundamental right to  of passengers whilst allowing for world-wide flows of personal data. Recommended Practice 1774 could serve as a basis for further developments and, with particular regard to international transfers, should be used to invite IATA members in third countries to work towards adequate protection. The Working Party appreciates the commitment of IATA to revise Recommended Practice 1724 on general  for carriage in order to include a direct reference to the Data Protection Recommended Practice 1774. By doing so, IATA raises awareness about the data protection issues and promotes the taking up of data protection in the contractual relationship between airlines and passengers, which is of particular relevance with regard to non-EU members of IATA. The Working Party encourages IATA to pursue the option to include a reference to data protection and  in the ticket itself and, to this end, to revise Resolution 724 on Ticket \u2013 Notice and  of Contract. The Working Party would also like to invite IATA to address the issue of frequent flyer schemes. The passengers have to be informed clearly about the purpose of such processing, the concrete way their data are used and by whom in a way that allows passengers to oppose such processing. Furthermore, airlines have to ensure that only those persons who are directly involved in the provision of the service requested by the passenger can access the personal data, but not all potential partners participating in a frequent flyer scheme. The Working Party reserves the possibility to issue further comments. 8 Annexes: - Recommended Practice 1774 Protection of  and transborder data flows of personal data used in international air transport of passengers and cargo - Explanatory memorandum to RP 1774 - Recommended Practice 1724 General  of Carriage (Passenger and Baggage) - Resolution 724 Ticket \u2013 Notice and  of Contract Done at Brussels, 14 September 2001 For the Working Party The Chairman Stefano RODOTA 9 1. RECOMMENDED PRACTICE 1774 PROTECTION OF  AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA USED IN INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT OF PASSENGERS AND CARGO RECOMMENDED that, Members, in conjunction with the provisions and compliance mechanisms of any individual national data  law, observe the following principles and procedures aimed at safeguarding the  rights of individuals. Taking into account the increasing flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing processing, considering the proliferation of data protection legislation and recognising the need to reconcile the fundamental values of respect for  of the individual and the need for free flow of information required for the functioning of the air transport industry, Members should observe the following guidelines: ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS \u201cPersonal data\u201d: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d) used for such purposes as passenger reservations, frequent flyers programmes, freight shipment, baggage tracing, and including (but not limited to) data such as name, surname, address (e.g. of passenger or shipper), and contact details. \u201cProcessing of personal data\u201d: includes the following operations, performed on personal data: collection, recording, organisation, storage, amendment, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure, erasure. This definition shall encompass personal data processed by other than automatic means provided that the personal data form part of a structured filing system, or are intended to form part of a structured filing system. \u201cData controller\u201d: the natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. \u201cData processor\u201d: the natural or legal person that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. \u201cData subject\u2019s consent\u201d: any freely given, specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed. ARTICLE 2: SCOPE 2.1. These guidelines apply to any processing of personal data under the control of a Member. 2.2. Nothing in these guidelines shall be construed as limiting Members from applying more stringent or additional measures or derogations contained in applicable national laws for the protection of  and individual liberties. 10 ARTICLE 3: PRINCIPLES 3.1. Quality of data: Personal data undergoing processing under the control of a Member must be: 3.1.1. processed fairly and lawfully, in accordance with the purpose specified; 3.1.2. adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes* for which they are processed; 3.1.3. accurate and, when necessary, brought up to date; 3.1.4. kept in a form which permits identification of the data subject for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. In practice, retention periods vary from airline to airline depending to a great extent on the legal requirements of any given country (for example, relating to litigation, taxation or accounting issues). Typically, and in the absence of special circumstances, it is common practice in the industry to archive reservations off line when it is no longer necessary to have immediate access to them to service the customer\u2019s needs. The archived reservations will be kept only as long as is necessary for lawful purposes. * The purposes for which data are typically collected and/or further processed in connection with the data subject\u2019s travel are: making a reservation, purchasing a ticket, obtaining and providing necessary ancillary services (e.g. catering, baggage tracing), developing and providing services, creating and administering frequent flyers programmes, facilitating immigration and customs procedures, and providing such facilitating data to government agencies, in accordance with local laws and regulations. 3.2. Information to data subject: Unless the data subject already has such information, he shall be informed of the identity of the controller and of the purposes of the processing. Where necessary to guarantee fair processing in respect of the data subject, and having regard to the specific circumstances in which the data are collected, information shall also be provided on the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify the data. This information shall be supplied at the time of data collection. 3.3. Right of access: The data controller shall establish procedures for: 3.3.1. disclosing the contents of a personal data file to the data subject, and shall make such disclosure upon the data subject\u2019s request, at reasonable intervals to be established by the Member and without excessive delay or expense. Such data shall be communicated to the data subject in an intelligible form; 11 3.3.2. allowing the data subject to exercise the right to rectify erroneous data or to delete data processed in contravention to the principles set out in this Recommended Practice or any relevant national laws. 3.4. Special categories of data: Personal data containing sensitive information pertaining to e.g. religious or philosophical beliefs or health , shall not be processed unless the data subject, directly or through his representative, has given his explicit consent, as may be provided by applicable national law. 3.5. Obligation to notify the supervisory authority: When processing personal data, Members shall duly notify the national supervisory authority of the relevant country, whose national law is applicable, when this requirement exists. This notification shall be provided before any processing operation is carried out, and shall comply with national provisions regarding its content and format. 3.6. Data security: Appropriate security measures shall be taken for the protection of personal data against accidental or unauthorised destruction or accidental loss as well as against unauthorised access, alteration and dissemination, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network. 3.7. Transfer of data to third countries Members will apply these guidelines to all processing of personal data they undertake anywhere in the world. Many transfers of personal data to a country other than the country in which the data is collected which are undertaken by Members are necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract with the data subject. In the case of other transfers to countries, which do not provide an adequate level of protection, members will consider whether it is necessary to obtain the consent of the data subject in order to ensure fair processing. The two most common contracts between carriers and data subjects are contracts for the transportation and contracts of membership in frequent flyers programmes. Information necessary to conclude or perform these contracts includes, but is not limited to, data required for the purposes of making a reservation, purchasing a ticket, obtaining and providing necessary ancillary services (e.g. catering, baggage tracing), awarding and redeeming frequent flyer awards, developing and providing services, facilitating immigration and entry procedures, and providing such data to government agencies, in connection with the passenger\u2019s travel. 12 EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM IATA RECOMMENDED PRACTICE 1774 \u2022 IATA: International Air Transport Association IATA is a trade organisation representing 2623 airlines operating scheduled passenger and/or cargo services. IATA was founded in 1945 and, as indicated in its Act of Incorporation, the purposes, objects and aims of the Association are: (a) to promote safe, regular and economical air transport for the benefit of the peoples of the world, to foster air commerce and to study the problems connected therewith; (b) to provide means for collaboration among the air transport enterprises engaged directly or indirectly in international air transport service; (c) to co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other international organisations. \u2022 Eligibility for Membership Only carriers operating commercial air services - passenger, mail or cargo - are eligible for membership. a) Active Membership Active Membership is open only to carriers operating an international air service for the public transport of passengers, mail or cargo by aircraft. Active members may elect to participate in either Passenger Tariff Co-ordination or Cargo Tariff Co-ordination, or both. b) Associate Membership Associate Membership is open to carriers operating only a domestic air service within the territory of only one State for the public transport of passengers, mail or cargo by aircraft. Associate Members may elect to become non-voting members of any Passenger or Cargo Traffic Conference. A Membership list (2623 Members) is attached. \u2022 IATA Traffic Conferences Recommended Practice 1774 is part of the Passenger Services Conference (PSC) Resolutions Manual. The PSC is one of the IATA Traffic Conferences established for passenger matters. This Conference meets annually, and membership consists of accredited representatives of all IATA member airlines: it has worldwide authority. The PSC agrees on standards and procedures for passenger and baggage handling, passenger reservations and passenger ticketing and automation standards. 13 The Conference provides a forum for discussion of new developments in the industry and the development of policies and procedures. Agreements reached at the PSC take the form of Resolutions or Recommended Practices. Only agreements in the form of a Resolution of a Traffic Conference are binding upon the Members thereof. A Recommended Practice sets forth the procedures which will facilitate the interlining of traffic amongst Members, without requiring strict uniformity in the implementation of those procedures. The other passenger-related IATA Traffic Conferences are: Passenger Agency Conference The Passenger Agency Conference takes action on matters relating to relationships between airlines and recognised passenger sales agents and other intermediaries but excluding remuneration levels. Passenger Tariff Co-ordinating Conferences These Conferences provide a multilateral, immunised forum for airlines to develop fares and associated tariff . \u2022 Traffic Conference Action - Voting Only action in the form of a resolution of Traffic Conference shall be binding upon the Members thereof, and no statement in the minutes of a meeting shall be construed as binding action upon such Members. The intended date of commencement of effectiveness of each resolution and of expiry thereof shall be prescribed by the Conference. Where a Member certifies in writing with respect to any action taken by a Traffic Conference that such action would require it to contravene an applicable law or regulation or official policy of the State of which such Member is a national, the Member shall not be bound thereby, and each other Member, upon receiving notice thereof from the Secretary, shall have the right to indicate to the Secretary whether it will continue to be bound thereby. Notice given under this paragraph shall continue until withdrawn in writing by the Member or until the expiry date of the resolution(s) concernEach voting Member of a Traffic Conference shall have only one vote, to be cast by its duly accredited representative, or by that representative\u2019s duly accredited alternate. There shall be no voting by proxy. Abstention or failure to vote on the part of any accredited representative (or his alternate) who is present at the meeting shall be deemed to be an affirmative vote except as hereinafter provided. A rRecommended pPractice, as the one we are submitting here, may be adopted at any meeting of a Services Conference by a majority of two-thirds of the voting Members present and voting. Abstentions shall not count in the vote. Recommended pPractices are for guidance of Members of the Conferences and are not binding on them. 14 \u2022 \u201cAcceptance\u201d of Recommended Practice 1774 This paragraph addresses the concerns of the Working Party related to the \u201cacceptance\u201d of Recommended Practice 1774. First, it should be stressed that RP1774 is a recommendation adopted by IATA mMembers within the forum of the Passenger Services Conference and as such, only commits IATA mMembers. In particular, RP1774 is not concerned with the obligations of CRSs and travel agents, which are covered by the new \u201cCouncil Regulation 323/1999 of 8 February 1999 amending Regulation N\u00b0 2299/89 on a code of conduct for computer reservation systems (CRSs)\u201d. Secondly, as explained above, a Recommended Practice is, by its very natureper se, not binding and there is no compliance mechanism in place. However, it should be clearly understood that all IATA Resolutions and Recommended Practices are not imposed by the IATA Secretariat but are adopted on a voluntary basis by the IATA mMembership in the democratic fora of the Conferences.: this can logically be considered as a form of guarantee that the self-imposed procedures will be applied. Finally, a Recommended Practice is in many instances only a suggested framework that individual members adapt to comply with their national requirements and according to their own individual commercial practices. A good analogy is RP 1724 \u201c of Carriage\u201d. Some carriers have adopted these  as such, without modification, but many others have used them as a recommended model and have adapted them to their individual regulatory and commercial environment. Similarly, RP 1774, as modified, will be presented to and for adoption by the IATA airlines (through the forum of PSC) to IATA airlines, but each airline will remain freeat liberty to create its own code of conduct vis-\u00e0-vis its own customers, and in accordance with national legal and regulatory requirements. Also for evident antitrust immunity reasons must IATA must avoid to imposeing any commercial behaviour toon its members. \u2022 Conclusions In view of the above, RP 1774 is not intended to be the final code of conduct for use as such by IATA Member airlines. It is rather designated to highlight some main aspects of the Directive and to be used as a guideline by Member airlines (or a group of Member airlines) when preparing a code of conduct to be presented to the data protection authorities concerned.

Our liability provisions are as follows: 15.1.1 Unless otherwise stated herein, international travel, as defined in the Convention, is subject to the liability rules of the Convention. 15.1.2 Where your carriage is not subject to the liability rules of the Convention, the following rules shall apply [each airline\u2019s own rules to be specified]: 15.1.2(a) Any liability we have for Damage, will be reduced by any negligence on your part which causes or contributes to the Damage in accordance with applicable law. 15.1.2(b) We will be liable only for Damage occurring during carriage on flights or flight segments where our Airline Designator Code appears in the carrier box of the Ticket for that flight or flight segment. If we issue a Ticket or if we check Baggage for carriage on another carrier, we do so only as agent for the other carrier. Nevertheless, with respect to Checked Baggage, you may make a claim against the first or last carrier. 31 (17) 15.1.2(c) We will not be liable for Damage to Unchecked Baggage unless such Damage is caused by our negligence. 15.1.2(d) We are not liable for any Damage arising from our compliance with applicable laws or Government rules and regulations, or from your failure to comply with the same. 15.1.2(e) Except in the case of an act or omission done with intent to cause Damage or recklessly and with knowledge that Damage would probably result, our liability in the case of Damage to Checked Baggage shall be limited to ........ per kilogram and in the case of Damage to Unchecked Baggage shall be limited to ........ per passenger, provided that if in accordance with applicable law different limits of liability are applicable such different limits shall apply. If the weight of the Baggage is not recorded on the Baggage Check, it is presumed that the total weight of the Checked Baggage does not exceed the applicable free baggage allowance for the class of carriage concerned. If in the case of Checked Baggage a higher value is declared pursuant to 8.7, our liability shall be limited to such higher declared value. 15.1.2(f) Our liability shall be limited to proven compensatory damages, and in any event, we shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, or any other form of non- compensatory damages. 15.1.2(g) We are not liable for any Damage caused by your Baggage. You shall be responsible for any Damage caused by your Baggage to other persons or property, including our property. 15.1.2(h) We shall have no liability whatsoever for Damage to articles not permitted to be contained in Checked Baggage under 8.3, including fragile or perishable items, items having a special value, such as money, jewellery, precious metals, computers, personal electronic devices, negotiable papers, securities, or other valuables, business documents, passports and other identification documents, or samples. 15.1.2(i) We are not responsible for any illness, injury or disability, including death, attributable to your physical condition or for the aggravation of such condition. 15.1.2(j) The contract of carriage, including these  of Carriage and exclusions or limits of liability, applies to our Authorised Agents, servants, employees and representatives to the same extent as they apply to us. The total amount recoverable from us and from such Authorised Agents, employees, representatives and persons shall not exceed the amount of our own liability, if any. 15.1.2(k) Nothing in these  of Carriage shall waive any exclusion or limitation of our liability under the Convention or applicable laws unless otherwise expressly stated. 32 (18) For carriers who are parties to the Montreal Agreement (1966) and which have not waived the Warsaw limits of liability. SPECIAL AGREEMENT Special Agreement applicable to carriage to, from or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America (see applicable U.S. tariffs). A) We shall avail ourselves of the limitation of liability provided in the Convention. However, in accordance with Article 22(1) of the Convention [name of issuing airline] and certain other carriers agree that as to all international carriage by such airlines to which the Convention applies and which according to the contract of carriage includes a point in the United States of America as a point of origin, a point of destination or agreed stopping place: (i) the limit of liability for each Passenger for death, wounding or other bodily injury shall be the sum of US$75,000 inclusive of legal fees and costs except that, in the case of a claim brought in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of US $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs; (ii) such carriers shall not, with respect to any claim arising out of the death, wounding or other bodily injury of a Passenger, avail themselves of any defence under Article 20(1) of the Convention. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of such airlines with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of, any person who has caused Damage which resulted in death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a Passenger. The names of carriers party to the agreement referred to in this Paragraph are available at all Ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Each of such carriers\u2019 has entered into the said agreement solely on its own behalf and with respect to carriage performed by it and has not thereby imposed any liability on any other airlines with respect to the portion of the carriage performed by such other carrier or assumed any liability with respect to the portion of the carriage performed by such other carrier. OR B) Airlines that have voluntarily waived, or are subject to legislation imposing a waiver of the Warsaw limits of liability for death or injury to passengers, should insert appropriate liability provisions. European Community Carriers will want to review the provisions of EC Regulation No. 2027/97. However, it is crucial that any waiver language be drafted so as to apply only on that airline\u2019s flights (flights on which its airline designator is indicated on the Ticket) to avoid waiving the limits for other (downline) \u201cCarriers\u201d. Examples of language used by Members in their own  or Tariff filings are available from the Secretariat upon request. 33 (19) ARTICLE 16 \u2014 TIME LIMITATION ON CLAIMS AND ACTIONS 16.1 NOTICE OF CLAIMS Acceptance of Baggage by the bearer of the Baggage Check without complaint at the time of delivery is sufficient evidence that the Baggage has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the contract of carriage, unless you prove otherwise. If you wish to file a claim or an action regarding Damage to Checked Baggage, you must notify us as soon as you discover the Damage, and at the latest, within seven (7) Days of receipt of the Baggage. If you wish to file a claim or an action regarding delay of Checked Baggage, you must notify us within twenty-one (21) Days from the date the Baggage has been placed at your disposal. Every such notification must be made in writing. 16.2 LIMITATION OF ACTIONS Any right to Damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years of the date of arrival at destination, or the date on which the aircraft was scheduled to arrive, or the date on which the carriage stopped. The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the court where the case is heard. ARTICLE 17 \u2014 MODIFICATION AND WAIVER None of our Authorised Agents, servants, employees or representatives has authority to alter, modify or waive any provision of these  of Carriage. ............................................................................................................................................... .....

For such passengers on a journey to, from or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed US$75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. For such passengers travelling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately US$10,000 or US$20,000. The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be exam-ined on request. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affec-ted by any limitation of the carrier\u2019s liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of carriage. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative. Note: The limit of liability of US$75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of US$58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs. 381 Y RESOLUTION 724 Attachment \u2018D\u2019 EU NOTICE 19TH EDITION, JUNE 1999 REQUIREMENT (for EU countries only) If your journey involves a destination or stop in a country other than the one from which you depart, the Warsaw Convention may govern the liability of all airlines involved in your journey, including any portion thereof within a single country. This Convention limits the liability of airlines for death or bodily injury and for baggage loss, delay or damage. Many air carriers, including all European Community air carriers, have waived the Warsaw Convention limits for death or bodily injury and the defence that they have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage for the first 100,000 Special Drawing Rights of any such claim. In addition, in cases of death or bodily injury, many air carriers will make advance payments to the person entitled to compensation, if required to meet immediate economic needs, in proportion to the hardship suffered. Community air carriers make such payments in accordance with Community law. Other air carriers may apply alternate provisions. (Attachment \u2018D\u2019 will expire on 31 March 2000). 40 c J Passenger Services Conference Resolutions Manual RESOLUTION 724a PASSENGER TICKET \u2014 NOTICE OF OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS (EXCEPT USA/US TERRITORIES) PSC(20)724a Expiry: Indefinite (except USA/US Territories) Type: A RESOLVED that, Notwithstanding Resolution 724, Members shall provide notice to the passenger relating to reservation status, only on its own services, stemming from any practice of over-booking. 1.

In addition the following paragraphs may be included on or with the Passenger Ticket and Baggage Check. In order to minimize the effect of \u201cno shows\u201d and to permit seats to be used by passengers who otherwise would not be able to travel on a chosen flight, carriers may overbook flights.

ISSUE OF TIR CARNETS; LIABILITY OF GUARANTEEING ASSOCIATIONS Article 6 1. Subject to such  and guarantees as it shall determine, each Contracting Party may authorize associations to issue TIR carnets, either directly or through corresponding associations, and to act as guarantors. 2. An association shall not be approved in any country unless its guarantee also covers the liabilities incurred in that country in connexion with operations under cover of TIR carnets issued by foreign associations affiliated to the same international organization as that to which it is itself affiliated. Article 7 TIR carnet forms sent to the guaranteeing associations by the corresponding foreign associations or by international organizations shall not be liable to import and export duties and taxes and shall be free of import and export prohibitions and restrictions. Article 8 1. The guaranteeing association shall undertake to pay the import or export duties and taxes, together with any default interest, due under the Customs laws and regulations of the country in which an irregularity has been noted in connexion with a TIR operation. It shall be liable, jointly and severally with the persons from whom the sums mentioned above are due, for payment of such sums. 2. In cases where the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party do not provide for payment of import or export duties and taxes as provided for in paragraph 1 above, the guaranteeing association shall undertake to pay, under the same , a sum equal to the amount of the import or export duties and taxes and any default interest. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s______93 3. Each Contracting Party shall determine the maximum sum per TIR carnet, which may be claimed from the guaranteeing association of the basis of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above. 4. The liability of the guaranteeing association to the authorities of the country where the Customs office of departure is situated shall commence at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the Customs office. In the succeeding countries through which goods are transported under the TIR procedure, this liability shall commence at the time when the goods are imported or, where the TIR operation has been suspended under article 26, paragraphs 1 and 2, at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the Customs office where the TIR operation is resumed. 5. The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods which are enumerated in the TIR carnet but also any goods which, though not enumerated therein, may be contained in the sealed section of the road vehicle or in the sealed container. It shall not extend to any other goods. 6. For the purpose of determining the duties and taxes mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, the particulars of the goods as entered in the TIR carnet shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be assumed to be correct. 7. When payment of sums mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article becomes due, the competent authorities shall so far as possible require payment from the person or persons directly liable before making a claim against the guaranteeing association. Article 9 1. The guaranteeing association shall fix the period of validity of the TIR carnet by specifying a final date of validity after which the carnet may not be presented for acceptance at the Customs office of departure. 2. Provided that it has been accepted by the Customs office of departure on or before the final date of validity, as provided for in paragraph 1 of this article, the carnet shall remain valid until the termination of the TIR operation at the Customs office of destination. Article 10 1. The TIR carnet may be discharged unconditionally or conditionally; where discharge is conditional this shall be on account of facts connected with the TIR operation itself. These facts shall be clearly indicated in the TIR carnet. 2. When the Customs authorities of a country have discharged a TIR carnet unconditionally they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of the sums mentioned in article 8, paragraphs 1 and 2, unless the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner. Article 11 1. Where a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged conditionally, the competent authorities shall not have the right to claim payment of the sums mentioned in article 8, paragraphs 1 and 2, from the guaranteeing association unless, within a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the TIR carnet by those authorities, they have notified the association in writing of the non-discharge or conditional discharge. The same provision shall apply where the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner, save that the period shall be two years. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 94______United Nations \u2014 Tteaty S\u00e9ries \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s_____1978 2. The claim for payment of the sums referred to in article 8, paragraphs 1 and 2, shall be made to the guaranteeing association at the earliest three months after the date on which the association was informed that the carnet had not been discharged or had been discharged conditionally or that the certificate of discharge had been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner and at the latest not more than two years after that date. However, in cases which, during the above-mentioned period of two years, become the subject of legal proceedings, any claim for payment shall be made within one year of the date on which the decision of the court becomes enforceable. 3. The guaranteeing association shall have a period of three months, from the date when a claim for payment is made upon it, in which to pay the amounts claimed. The sums paid shall be reimbursed to the association if, within the two years following the date on which the claim for payment was made, it has been established to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that no irregularity was committed in connexion with the transport operation in question. CHAPTER in. TRANSPORT OF GOODS UNDER TIR CARNET (a) APPROVAL OF VEHICLES AND CONTAINERS Article 12 In order to fall within the provisions of sections (a) and (b) of this chapter, every road vehicle must as regards its construction and equipment fulfil the  set out in annex 2 to this Convention and must have been approved according to the procedure laid down in annex 3 to this Convention. The certificate of approval shall conform to the specimen reproduced in annex 4. Article 13 1. To fall within the provisions of sections (a) and (b) of this chapter, containers must be constructed in conformity with the  laid down in part I of annex 7 and must have been approved according to the procedure laid down in part II of that annex. 2. Containers approved for the transport of goods under Customs seal in accordance with the Customs Convention on Containers, 1956,' the agreements arising therefrom concluded under the auspices of the United Nations, the Customs Convention on Containers, 1972,2 or any international instruments that may supersede or modify the latter Convention, shall be considered as complying with the provisions of paragraph 1 above and must be accepted for transport under the TIR procedure without further approval. Article 14 1. Each Contracting Party reserves the right to refuse to recognize the validity of the approval of road vehicles or containers which do not meet the  set forth in articles 12 and 13 above. Nevertheless, Contracting Parties shall avoid delaying traffic when the defects found are of minor importance and do not involve any risk of smuggling. 2. Before it is used again for the transport of goods under Customs seal, any road vehicle or container which no longer meets the  which justified its approval, shall be either restored to its original state, or presented for reapproval. 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 338, p, 103. 2 Ibid., vol. 988, p. 43. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s______95 (b) PROCEDURE FOR TRANSPORT UNDER COVER OF A TIR CARNET Article 15 1. No special Customs document shall be required in respect of the temporary importation of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container carrying goods under cover of the TIR procedure. No guarantee shall be required for the road vehicle or combination of vehicles or container. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not prevent a Contracting Party from requiring the fulfilment at the Customs office of destination of the formalities laid down by its national regulations to ensure that, once the TIR operation has been completed, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container will be re- exported. Article 16 When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation, one rectangular plate bearing the inscription \"TIR\" and conforming to the specifications given in annex 5 to this Convention, shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles. These plates shall be so placed as to be clearly visible and shall be removable. Article 17 1. A single TIR carnet shall be made out in respect of each road vehicle or container. However, a single TIR carnet may be made out in respect of a combination of vehicles or for several containers loaded on to a single road vehicle or on to a combination of vehicles. In that case the TIR manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall list separately the contents of each vehicle in the combination of vehicles or of each container. 2. The TIR carnet shall be valid for one journey only. It shall contain at least the number of detachable vouchers for Customs acceptance and for discharge which are necessary for the transport operation in question. Article 18 A TIR operation may involve several Customs offices of departure and destination, but, save as may otherwise be authorized by the Contracting Party or Parties concerned, (a) the Customs offices of departure shall be situated in only one country; (b) the Customs offices of destination shall be situated in not more than two countries; (c) the total number of Customs offices of departure and destination shall not exceed four. Article 19 The goods and the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced with the TIR carnet at the Customs office of departure. The Customs authorities of the country of departure shall take such measures as are necessary for satisfying themselves as to the accuracy of the goods manifest and either for affixing the Customs seals or for checking Customs seals affixed under the responsibility of the said Customs authorities by duly authorized persons. Vol. 1079, I-16510 96______United Nations \u2014 Treaty S\u00e9ries \u00bb Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des TVait\u00e9s_____1978 Article 20 For journeys in the territory of their country, the Customs authorities may fix a time- limit and require the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container to follow a prescribed route. Article 21 At each Customs office en route and at Customs offices of destination, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced for purposes of control to the Customs authorities together with the load and the TIR carnet relating thereto. Article 22 1. As a general rule and except when they examine the goods in accordance with article 5, paragraph 2, the Customs authorities of the Customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the Customs seals of other Contracting Parties, provided that they are intact. The said Customs authorities may, however, if control requirements make it necessary, add their own seals. 2. The Customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals. Article 23 The Customs authorities shall not require road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers to be escorted at the carriers' expense on the territory of their country, require examination en route of road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers and their loads except in special cases. Article 24 If the Customs authorities conduct an examination of the load of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container in the course of the journey or at a Customs office en route, they shall record on the TIR carnet vouchers used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils, and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet, particulars of the new seals affixed and of the controls carried out. Article 25 If the Customs seals are broken en route otherwise than in the circumstances of articles 24 and 35, or if any goods are destroyed or damaged without breaking of such seals, the procedure laid down in annex 1 to this Convention for the use of the TIR carnet shall, without prejudice to the possible application of the provisions of national law, be followed, and the certified report in the TIR carnet shall be completed. Article 26 1. When transport under cover of a TIR carnet takes place in part in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Party to this Convention, the TIR operation shall be suspended during that part of the journey. In that case, the Customs authorities of the Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s______97 Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation, provided that the Customs seals and/or identifying marks have remained intact. 2. The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler Customs transit procedures or when the use of a Customs transit r gime is not necessary. 3. In such cases the Customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be Customs offices of exit e\u00ab route and Customs offices of entry en route respectively. Article 27 Subject to the provisions of this Convention and in particular of article 18, another Customs office of destination may be substituted for a Customs office of destination originally indicated. Article 28 On arrival of the load at the Customs office of destination, and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of Customs control or are cleared for home use, discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay. (c) PROVISIONS CONCERNING TRANSPORT OF HEAVY OR BULKY GOODS Article 29 1. The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in article 1, subparagraph (k), of this Convention. 2. Where the provisions of this section apply, heavy or bulky goods may, if the authorities at the Customs office of departure so decide, be carried by means of non-sealed vehicles or containers. 3. The provisions of this section shall apply only if, in the opinion of the authorities at the Customs office of departure, the heavy or bulky goods carried and any accessories carried with them can be easily identified by reference to the description given, or can be provided with Customs seals and/or identifying marks so as to prevent any substitution, or removal of the goods, without it being obvious. Article 30 All the provisions of this Convention, save those to which the special provisions of this section make an exception, shall apply to the transport of heavy or bulky goods under the TIR procedure. Article 31 The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet, but also any goods which, though not enumerated in the carnet, are on the load platform or among the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 98______United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des TVait\u00e9s_____1978 Article 32 The cover and all vouchers of the TIR carnet shall bear the endorsement \"heavy or bulky goods\" in bold letters in English or in French. Article 33 The authorities at the Customs office of departure may require such packing lists, photographs, drawings, etc., as are necessary for the identification of the goods carried to be appended to the TIR carnet. In this case they shall endorse these documents, one copy of the said documents shall be attached to the inside of the cover page of the TIR carnet, and all the manifests of the TIR carnet shall include a reference to such documents. Article 34 The authorities at the Customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the Customs seals and/or identifying marks affixed by the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties. They may, however, affix additional seals and/or identifying marks; they shall record particulars of the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet. Article 35 If Customs authorities conducting an examination of the load at a Customs office en route or in the course of the journey are obliged to break seals and/or remove identifying marks, they shall record the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet. CHAPTER iv. IRREGULARITIES Article 36 Any breach of the provisions of this Convention shall render the offender liable, in the country where the offence was committed, to the penalties prescribed by the law of that country. Article 37 When it is not possible to establish in which territory an irregularity was committed, it shall be deemed to have been committed in the territory of the Contracting Party where it is detected. Article 38 1. Each of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to exclude temporarily or permanently from the operation of this Convention any person guilty of a serious offence against the Customs laws or regulations applicable to the international transport of goods. 2. This exclusion shall be notified immediately to the Customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the person concerned is established or resident, and also to the guaranteeing association(s) in the country where the offence has been committed. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Tt-ait\u00e9s______99 Article 39 When TIR operations are accepted as being otherwise in order: 1. The Contracting Parties shall disregard minor discrepancies in the observance of time-limits or routes prescribed. 2. Likewise, discrepancies between the particulars on the goods manifest of the TIR carnet and the actual contents of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container shall not be considered as infringements of the Convention by the holder of the TIR carnet when evidence is produced to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that these discrepancies were not due to mistakes committed knowingly or through negligence at the time when the goods were loaded or dispatched or when the manifest was made out. Article 40 The Customs administrations of the countries of departure and of destination shall not consider the holder of the TIR carnet responsible for the discrepancies which may be discovered in those countries, when the discrepancies in fact relate to the Customs procedures which preceded or followed a TIR operation and in which the holder was not involved. Article 41 When it is established to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that goods specified on the manifest of a TIR carnet have been destroyed or have been irrecoverably lost by accident or force majeure or that they are short by reason of their nature, payment of the duties and taxes normally due shall be waived. Article 42 On receipt from a Contracting Party of a request giving the relevant reasons, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned in a TIR operation shall furnish that Contracting Party with all the available information needed for implementa tion of the provisions of articles 39, 40 and 41 above.

ANNEX 2 REGULATIONS ON TECHNICAL  APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT UNDER CUSTOMS SEAL Article 1. BASIC PRINCIPLES Approval for the international transport of goods under Customs seal may be granted only to vehicles, the load compartments of which are constructed and equipped in such a manner that: (d) no goods can be removed from, or introduced into, the sealed part of the vehicle without leaving obvious traces of tampering or without breaking the Customs seal; (b) Customs seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them; 1 See inserts in a pocket at the end of the volume. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Tteaty S\u00e9ries \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil d\u00e9s li-ait\u00e9s_____105 (c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden; (d) all spaces capable of holding goods are readily accessible for Customs inspection. Article 2. STRUCTURE OF LOAD COMPARTMENTS 1. To meet the requirements of article 1 of these Regulations: (a) the constituent parts of the load compartment (sides, floor, doors, roof, uprights, frames, cross- pieces, etc.) shall be assembled either by means of devices which cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces or by such methods as will produce a structure which cannot be modified without leaving obvious traces. When the sides, floor, doors and roof are made up of various components, these shall meet the same requirements and be of sufficient strength; (b) doors and all other closing systems (including stopcocks, manhole-covers, flanges, etc.) shall be fitted with a device on which Customs seals can be fixed. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces, or the door or fastening be opened without breaking the Customs seals. The latter shall be adequately protected. Opening roofs shall be permitted; (c) apertures for ventilation and drainage shall be provided with a device preventing access to the interior of the load compartment. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of article 1 (c) of these Regulations, constituent parts of the load compartment which, for practical reasons, have to include empty spaces (for example, between the partitions of a double wall) shall be permitted. In order that the said spaces cannot be used to conceal goods: (i) where it covers the full height from floor to roof, or, in other cases, where the space between it and the outer wall is completely enclosed, the lining inside the load compartment shall be so fitted that it cannot be removed and replaced without leaving obvious traces; and (ii) where a lining is of less than full height and the spaces between the lining and the outer wall are not completely enclosed, and in all other cases where spaces occur in the construction of a load compartment, the number of such spaces shall be kept to a minimum and these spaces shall be readily accessible for Customs inspection. 3. Windows shall be allowed provided that they are made of materials of sufficient strength and that they cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces. Glass shall nevertheless be permitted, but in this case the window shall be fitted with a fixed metal grille which cannot be removed from the outside; the mesh of the grille shall not exceed 10 mm. 4. Openings made in the floor for technical purposes, such as lubrication, maintenance and filling of the sand-box, shall be allowed only on condition that they are fitted with a cover capable of being fixed in such a way as to render the load compartment inaccessible from the outside. Article 3. SHEETED VEHICLES 1. Where applicable, the provisions of articles 1 and 2 of these Regulations shall apply to sheeted vehicles. In addition, these vehicles shall conform to the provisions of this article. 2. The sheet shall be either of strong canvas or of plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, which shall be of sufficient strength and unstretchable. It shall be in good condition and made up in such a way that once the closing device has been secured, it is impossible to gain access to the load compartment without leaving obvious traces. 3. If the sheet is made up of several pieces, their edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two seams at least 15 mm apart. These seams shall be made as shown in Sketch No. 1 appended to these Regulations; however, where in the case of certain parts of the sheet (such as flaps and reinforced corners) it is not possible to assemble the pieces in that way, it shall be sufficient to fold the edge of the top section and make the seams as shown in Sketches Nos. 2 or 2 (a) appended to these Regulations. One of the seams shall be visible only from the inside and the colour of the thread used for that seam shall be clearly different from the colour of the sheet itself and from the colour of the thread used for the other seam. All seams shall be machine-sewn. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 106______United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s_____\u00cf978 4. If the sheet is of plastic-covered cloth, and is made up of several pieces, the pieces may alternatively be welded together in the manner shown in Sketch No. 3 appended to these Regulations. The edges of the pieces shall overlap by at least 15 mm. The pieces shall be fused together over the whole width of the overlap. The edge of the outer sheet shall be covered with a band of plastic material at least 7 mm wide, affixed by the same welding process. The plastic band and the sheet on each side of it for a width of at least 3 mm shall have a clearly defined uniform relief pattern stamped on them. The pieces shall be welded in such a way that they cannot be separated and rejoined without leaving obvious traces. 5. Repairs shall be made in accordance with the method described in Sketch No. 4 appended to these Regulations; the edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two visible seams at least 15 mm apart; the colour of the thread visible from the inside shall be different from that of the thread visible from the outside and from that of the sheet itself; all seams shall be machine-sewn. When a sheet which has been damaged near the edges is repaired by replacing the damaged part by a patch, the seam can also be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this article and Sketch No. 1 appended to these Regulations. Sheets of plastic- covered cloth may alternatively be repaired in accordance with the method described in paragraph 4 of this article, but in that case the plastic band must be affixed to both sides of the sheet, the patch being fitted on the inside of the sheet. 6. (a) The sheet shall be fixed to the vehicle in strict compliance with the  set forth in article 1 (a) and (b) of these Regulations. The following types of fastening shall be provided: (i) metal rings fixed to the vehicles; (ii) eyelets let into the edge of the sheet; (iii) a fastening passing through the rings above the sheet and visible from the outside for its entire length. The sheet shall overlap solid parts of the vehicle by at least 250 mm, measured from the centre of the securing rings, unless the system of construction of the vehicle in itself prevents all access to the load compartment. (b) When any edge of a sheet is to be permanently secured to a vehicle, the two surfaces shall be joined together without a break and shall be held in place by strong devices. 7. The sheet shall be supported by an adequate superstructure (uprights, sides, arches, slats, etc.). 8. The spaces between the rings and the spaces between the eyelets shall not exceed 200 mm. The eyelets shall be reinforced. 9. The following fastenings shall be used: (a) steel wire ropes of at least 3 mm diameter; or (b) ropes of hemp or sisal of at least 8 mm diameter encased in a transparent sheath of unstretchable plastic. Wire ropes may have a transparent sheath of unstretchable plastic. 10. Each rope shall be in one piece and have a hard metal end-piece at each end. The fastener of each metal end-piece shall include a hollow rivet passing through the rope so as to allow the introduction of the thread or strap of the Customs seal. The rope shall remain visible on either side of the hollow rivet so that it is possible to ensure that the rope is in one piece (see Sketch No. 5 appended to these Regulations). 1 h At the openings in the sheet, used for  and un, the two edges of the sheet shall have an adequate overlap. They shall also be fastened by: (a) a flap sewn or welded in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article; (b) rings and eyelets meeting the  of paragraph 8 of this article; and (c) a thong made of appropriate material, in one piece and unstretchable, at least 20 mm wide and 3 mm thick, passing through the rings and holding together the two edges of the sheet and the flap; the thong shall be secured inside the sheet and fitted with an eyelet to take the rope mentioned in paragraph 9 of this article. A flap shall not be required if a special device, such as a baffle plate, is fitted, which prevents access to the load compartment without leaving obvious traces.

Road vehicles may be approved by one of the following procedures: (a) individually, or (b) by design type (series of road vehicles). 2. An approval certificate conforming to the standard form of annex 4 shall be issued for approved vehicles. This certificate shall be printed in the language of the country of issue and in French or English. When the authority which has granted the approval deems it necessary, photographs or diagrams authenticated by that authority shall be attached to the certificate. The number of those documents shall then be inserted by that authority under Item No. 6 of the approval certificate. 3. The approval certificate shall be kept on the road vehicle, 4. Road vehicles shall be produced every two years, for the purposes of inspection and of renewal of approval where appropriate, to the competent authorities of the country in which the vehicle is registered or, in the case of unregistered vehicles, of the country in which the owner or user is resident. 5. If a road vehicle no longer complies with the technical  prescribed for its approval, it shall, before it can be used for the transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets, be restored to the condition which had justified its approval so as to comply again with the said technical . 6. If the essential characteristics of a road vehicle are changed, the vehicle shall cease to be covered by the approval and shall be reapproved by the competent authority before it can be used for the transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets. 7. The competent authorities of the country of registration of the vehicle or, in the case of vehicles for which registration is not required, the competent authorities of the country where the owner or user of the vehicle is established may, as the case may be, withdraw or renew the approval certificate or issue a new approval certificate in the circumstances set out in article 14 of this Convention and in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this annex. Procedure for individual approval 8. The owner, the operator or the representative of either shall apply to the competent authority for individual approval. The competent authority shall inspect the road vehicle produced in accordance with the general rules laid down in paragraphs 1 to 7 above and shall satisfy itself that the vehicle complies with the technical  prescribed in annex 2, and after approval shall issue a certificate conforming to the model in annex 4. Procedure for approval by design type (series of road vehicles) 9. Where road vehicles are manufactured by type series, the manufacturer may apply to the competent authority of the country of manufacture for approval by design-type. 10. The manufacturer shall state in his application the identification numbers or letters which he assigns to the type of road vehicle to which his application for approval relates. 11. The application shall be accompanied by drawings and a detailed design specification of the type of road vehicle to be approved. 12. The manufacturer shall give an undertaking in writing that he will: (a) produce to the competent authority such vehicles of the type concerned as that authority may wish to examine; (b) permit the competent authority to examine further units at any time during the production of the type series concerned; Vol. 1079, 1-16510 114______United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des 1>ait\u00e9s_____1978 (c) advise the competent authority of any change, however small, in the design or specification before proceeding with such change; (d) mark the road vehicles in a visible place with the identification numbers or letters of the design- type and the serial number of the vehicle in the type series (manufacturer's number); (e) keep a record of vehicles manufactured to the approved design-type. 13. The competent authority shall state what changes, if any, must be made to the proposed design-type in order that approval may be granted. 14. No approval by design-type shall be granted unless the competent authority has satisfied itself by examination of one or more vehicles manufactured to the design-type concerned that vehicles of that type comply with the technical  prescribed in annex 2. 15. The competent authority shall notify the manufacturer in writing of its decision to grant approval by design-type. This decision shall be dated and numbered. The authority which took the decision shall be clearly designated. 16. The competent authority shall take the necessary steps to issue an approval certificate, which it has duly signed, in respect of every vehicle built in conformity with an approved design- type. 17. The holder of the approval certificate shall, before using the vehicle for the carriage of goods under the cover of a TIR carnet, fill in, as may be required, on the approval certificate: \u2014 the registration number given to the vehicle (Item No. 1); or \u2014 in the case of a vehicle not subject to registration, particulars of his name and business address (Item No. 8). 18. When a vehicle which has been approved by design-type is exported to another country which is a Contracting Party to this Convention, no further approval procedure shall be required in that country on account of its importation. Procedure for endorsement of the certificate of approval 19. When an approved vehicle, carrying goods under cover of a TIR carnet, is found to have major defects, the competent authorities of Contracting Parties may either refuse to allow the vehicle to continue its journey under a TIR carnet, or allow the vehicle to continue its journey under a TIR carnet on its territory while taking the necessary security precautions. The approved vehicle must be restored to a satisfactory state as rapidly as possible, and in any case before it is again used for the transport of goods under cover of a TIR carnet. 20. In each of these cases the Customs authorities shall make an appropriate endorsement in Item No. 10 of the certificate of approval of the vehicle. When the vehicle has been restored to a condition which justifies approval, it shall be presented to the competent authorities of a Contracting Party who shall revalidate the certificate by adding an endorsement to Item No. 11 cancelling the earlier observations. No vehicle, the certificate of which has been endorsed at Item No. 10 under the provisions of the preceding paragraph, may again be used for the transport of goods under a TIR carnet until it has been restored to a satisfactory condition and until the endorsement in Item No. 10 has been cancelled as stated above. 21. Each endorsement made on the certificate shall be dated and authenticated by the competent authorities. 22. When a vehicle is found to have defects which the Customs authorities consider to be of minor importance and not involving the risk of smuggling, the continued use of the vehicle for the transport of goods under cover of a TIR carnet can be authorized. The holder of the approval certificate shall be notified of the defects and shall restore his vehicle to a satisfactory state within a reasonable time.

ANNEX 6 EXPLANATORY NOTES Introduction (i) In accordance with the provisions of article 43 of this Convention, the explanatory notes interpret certain provisions of this Convention and of its annexes. They also describe certain recommended practices. (ii) The explanatory notes do not modify the provisions of this Convention or of its annexes but merely make their contents, meaning and scope more precise. (iii) In particular, having regard to the provisions of article 12 of this Convention and of annex 2 relating to the technical  for the approval of road vehicles for transport under Customs seal, the explanatory notes specify, where appropriate, the construction techniques to be accepted by the Contracting Parties as complying with those provisions. The explanatory notes also specify, where appropriate, which construction techniques do not comply with those provisions. (iv) The explanatory notes provide a means of applying the provisions of this Convention and of its annexes so as to take into account the development of technology and economic requirements. 0 MAIN TEXT OF THE CONVENTION 0.1 Article 1 0.1 (b) The fees and charges excepted in article 1, subparagraph (b), mean all sums, other than import or export duties and taxes, levied by Contracting Parties on or in connexion with importation or exportation. These sums shall be limited in amount to the approximate cost of the services rendered and shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a tax on imports or exports for fiscal purposes. Such fees and charges include inter alia payments relating to: \u2014 certificates of origin if they are required for transit; \u2014 analyses carried out by Customs laboratories for control purposes; \u2014 Customs inspections and other clearance operations carried out outside normal working hours or away from Customs offices; \u2014 inspections for sanitary, veterinary or phytopathological reasons. 0.1 (e) The term \"demountable body\" means a load compartment which has no means of locomotion and which is designed to be transported upon a road vehicle, the chassis of which, together with the under-framing of the body, is specially adapted for this purpose. 0.1 (e) (i) The term \"partially enclosed\", as applied to equipment in article 1, subparagraph (e) (i), relates to equipment generally consisting of a floor and a superstructure marking off a  space equivalent to that of a closed container. The superstructure is generally made up of metal members forming the frame of a container. Containers of this type may also comprise one or more lateral or frontal walls. In some cases there is only a roof attached to the floor by uprights. This type of container is used in particular for the transport of bulky goods (motor cars, for example). Vol. 1079, 1-16510 118______United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s_____1978 0.2 Article 2 0.2-1 Article 2 provides that a transport operation under cover of a TIR carnet may begin and end in the same country on condition that part of the journey is performed in foreign territory. In such cases there is nothing to prevent the Customs authorities of the country of departure from requiring, in addition to the TIR carnet, a national document, intended to ensure duty-free reimportation of the goods. It is nevertheless recommended that Customs authorities should not insist on the use of such a document but accept instead an appropriate endorsement on the TIR carnet. 0.2-2 The provisions of this article allow goods to be carried under cover of a TIR carnet when only part of the journey is made by road. They do not specify what part of the journey has to be made by road and it is sufficient that this should occur at some point between the beginning and the end of the TIR operation. However, it may happen that, for unforeseen reasons of a commercial or accidental nature, no part of the journey can be made by road, despite the intentions of the sender at the start of the journey. In these exceptional cases the Contracting Parties shall nevertheless accept the TIR carnet and the liability of the guaranteeing associa tions shall remain in force. 0.5 Article 5 This article does not exclude the right to carry out spot checks on the goods but stresses that these checks should be very limited in number. The international TIR carnet procedure, in fact, provides protection greater than that given by national procedures. Firstly the particulars on the TIR carnet relating to the goods must agree with the particulars given on the Customs documents which may be required in the country of departure. In addition the countries of transit and destination are given protection by the controls which are carried out at departure and which are certified by the Customs authorities at the office of departure. (See note below to article 19.) 0.6.2 Article 6, paragraph 2 Under the provisions of this paragraph, the Customs authorities of a country may approve more than one association, each of which may incur liability arising from the operations undertaken under cover of the carnets issued by it or by its corresponding associations. 0.8.3 Article 8, paragraph 3 Customs authorities are recommended to limit to a sum equal to $US50,000 per TIR carnet the maximum amount which may be claimed from the guaranteeing association. 0.8.6 Article 8, paragraph 6 1. In the absence in the TIR carnet of particulars detailed enough to enable charges on the goods to be determined, the parties concerned may produce evidence of their precise nature. 2. If no evidence is furnished, duties and taxes will be charged, not at a flat rate unrelated to the nature of the goods, but at the highest rate applicable to the kind of goods covered by the particulars in the TIR carnet. 0.10 Article 10 The certificate of discharge of the TIR carnet shall be regarded as having been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner when the TIR operation has been carried out by means of load compartments or containers adapted for fraudulent purposes, or when such malpractices as the use of false or inaccurate documents, the substitution of goods, tampering with Customs seals, etc., have been discovered, or when the certificate has been obtained by other illicit means.

In that case, the provisions of article 15 may be observed, while assuring adequate protection for the Customs authorities, by recording particulars of these vehicles (make and numbers) on vouchers 1 and 2 of the TIR carnet used by the countries concerned and on the corresponding counterfoils. 0.17 Article 17 0.17-1 The provision that the manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall show separately the contents of each vehicle of a combination of vehicles, or of each container, is only intended to simplify Customs inspection of the contents of each vehicle or container. This provision shall not therefore be interpreted so rigidly that each variation between the actual contents of a vehicle or container and the contents of that vehicle or container as shown on the manifest is considered a breach of the provisions of the Convention. If the carrier can satisfy the relevant authorities that, notwithstanding such a variation, all the goods shown on the manifest agree with the total of goods loaded in the combination of vehicles or in all the containers covered by the TIR carnet, this shall not normally be considered a breach of Customs requirements. 0.17-2 In the case of household removals, the procedure laid down in para graph 10 (c) of the Rules for the use of the TIR carnet can be applied, the list of articles concerned being reasonably condensed. 0.18 Article 18 0.18-1 It is essential for the smooth operation of the TIR procedure that the Customs authorities of one country should refuse to designate a Customs office of exit as a Customs office of destination for a transport operation which is going on to a neighbouring country when that country is also a Contracting Party to this Convention, unless there are some special circumstances to justify the request. 0.18-2 1. Goods should be so loaded that the consignment to be unloaded at the first un point can be taken out of the vehicle or the container without it being necessary to unload the other consignment or consignments of goods due to be unloaded at the other un points. 2. Where a transport operation involves un at more than one office, it is necessary that, after a partial un, a record of it should be made in box 12 on all the remaining manifests of the TIR carnet, and at the same time another record should be made on the remaining vouchers and the corresponding counterfoils to the effect that new seals have been affixed. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 120______United Nations \u2014 Iteaty S\u00e9ries \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Thut\u00e9s_____1978 0.19 Article 19 The requirement that the Customs office of departure should check the accuracy of the goods manifest implies the need to verify at least that the particulars in the goods manifest tally with those in the export documents and in the transport or other commercial documents relating to the goods; the Customs office of departure may also have to examine the goods. The Customs office of departure must also, before affixing seals, check the condition of the road vehicle or container and, in the case of sheeted vehicles or containers, the condition of the sheets and sheet fastenings, as this equipment is not included in the certificate of approval. 0.20 Article 20 When fixing time-limits for the transport of goods within their territory, Customs authorities must likewise take into account inter alia any special regulations to which carriers are subject, particularly regulations concerning working hours and mandatory rest periods for drivers of road vehicles. It is recommended that these authorities should exercise their right to prescribe a route only when they consider it essential. 0.21 Article 21 0.21-1 The provisions of this article do not restrict the right of Customs authorities to examine all parts of a vehicle other than the sealed load compartment. 0.21-2 The Customs office of entry may turn back the carrier to the Customs office of exit of the adjacent country if it finds that no clearance has been given by that office or that clearance has not been given in due form. In such cases the Customs office of entry inserts a note in the TIR carnet for the Customs office of exit concerned. 0.21-3 If in the course of an examination, Customs authorities draw samples of goods, a note recording full particulars of the goods taken must be made by those authorities on the goods manifest of the TIR carnet. 0.28 Article 28 1. Article 28 provides that discharge of the TIR carnet at the office of destination shall take place without delay, on condition that the goods are placed under another Customs procedure or cleared for home use. 2. The use of the TIR carnet must be restricted to the function which it was intended to cover, namely the transit operation. The TIR carnet must not, for example, be used to cover the storage of goods under Customs control at destination. Where no irregularity has taken place, the office of destination must discharge the TIR carnet as soon as the goods covered by the carnet have come under another Customs procedure or have been cleared for home use. In practice, discharge must be given as soon as the goods have been directly re-exported (as, for example, when they are shipped on arrival at a port), or as soon as a declaration for Customs purposes has been made at the place of destination, or as soon as the goods have been received into a place approved for storage while awaiting a declaration for Customs purposes (for example, a transit shed), in accordance with the regulations in force in the country of destination. 0.29 Article 29 No certificate of approval is required for road vehicles or containers transporting heavy or bulky goods. It is, nevertheless, the responsibility of the Customs office of departure to make sure that the other  laid down in this article for this type of transport operation are met. Customs offices of other Contracting Parties shall accept the decision of the Customs office of departure unless in their opinion it is clearly in conflict with the provisions of article 29.

However, conventional rivets (i.e., rivets whose placing requires handling from both sides of the assembly of constituent parts) may also be inserted from the inside. Notwithstanding the above, load compartment floors may be secured by means of self-tapping screws, or self-drilling rivets or rivets inserted by means of an explosive charge, when placed from inside and passing at right-angles through the floor and the metallic cross-pieces underneath, on condition, except in the case of self-tapping screws, that some of their ends be flush with the level of the outside part of the cross-piece or be welded on to it. (b) The competent authority shall determine what joining devices, and how many of them, must fulfil the requirements of subparagraph (a) of this note; they shall do so by making sure that the constituent parts so assembled cannot be displaced and replaced without leaving obvious traces. The choice and placing of other joining devices are not subject to any restriction. (c) Joining devices which can be removed and replaced from one side without leaving obvious traces, i.e., without requiring handling from both sides of the constituent parts to be assembled, shall not be allowed under subparagraph (a) of this note. Examples of such devices are expansion rivets, blind rivets and the like. (d) The assembly methods described above shall apply to special vehicles, for example to insulated vehicles, refrigerated vehicles and tank-vehicles in so far as they are not incompatible with the technical requirements which such vehicles must fulfil having regard to their use. Where, due to technical reasons, it is not practicable to secure parts in the manner described in subparagraph (a) of this note, the constituent parts may be joined by means of the devices mentioned in subparagraph (c) of this note provided that the devices used on the inner face of the wall are not accessible from the outside.

It must also: (iii) incorporate holes of not less than 11 mm in diameter or slots of at least 11 mm in length by 3 mm in width, and (iv) afford equal security whatever type of seal is used. (b) Butt hinges, strap hinges, hinge-pins and other devices for hanging doors and the like must be secured in conformity with the requirements of subparagraphs (a) (i) and (ii) of this note. Moreover, the various components of such devices (e.g., hinge-plates, pins or swivels) must be so fitted that they cannot be removed or dismantled when the load compartment is closed and sealed without leaving obvious traces. However, where such a device is not accessible from outside it will suffice if, when the door or the like has been closed and sealed, it cannot be detached from the hinge or similar device without leaving obvious traces. Where a door or closure-device has more than two hinges, only those two hinges nearest to the extremities of the door need to be fixed in conformity with the requirements of subparagraph (a) (i) and (ii) above. (c) Exceptionally, in the case of vehicles having insulated load compart ments, the Customs sealing device, the hinges and any fittings, the removal of which would give access to the interior of the load compartment or to spaces in which goods could be concealed, may be fixed to the doors of such load compartments by means of set bolts or set screws which are inserted from the outside but which do. not otherwise meet the requirements of explanatory note 2.2.1 (a), subparagraph (a), above, on condition that: (i) the tails of the set bolts or set screws are fixed into a tapping plate or similar device fitted behind the outer layer or layers of the door structure; and (ii) the heads of the appropriate number of set bolts or set screws are so welded to the Customs sealing device, hinges, etc., that they are completely deformed and that the set bolts or set screws cannot be removed without leaving visible signs of tampering.* The term \"insulated load compartment\" is to be taken to include refrigerated and isothermic load compartments. (d) Vehicles comprising a large number of such closures as valves, stopcocks, manhole covers, flanges and the like must be designed so as to keep the number of Customs seals to a minimum. To this end, neighbouring closures must be interconnected by a common device requiring only one Custom seal, or must be provided with a cover meeting the same purpose. (e) Vehicles with opening roofs must be constructed in such manner as to permit sealing with a minimum number of Customs seals. 2.2.1 (c)-l Subparagraph 1 (c), Ventilation apertures (a) Their greatest dimension must, in principle, not exceed 400 mm. (b) Apertures permitting direct access to the load compartment, must be obstructed by means of wire gauze or perforated metal screens (maximum dimension of holes: 3 mm in both cases) and protected by welded metal lattice work (maximum dimension of holes: 10 mm). (c) Apertures not permitting direct access to the load compartment (e.g., because of elbow or baffle-plate systems) must be provided with the same devices, * See Sketch No. 1 appended to this annex. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 1978_____United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s______123 in which, however, the dimensions of the holes may be as much as 10 mm and 20 mm respectively. (d) Where openings are made in sheets, the devices referred to in subparagraph (b) of this note must in principle be prescribed. However, blocking devices in the form of a perforated metal screen fitted outside, and wire or other gauze fitted inside, will be allowed. (\u00eb) Identical non-metal devices may be allowed provided that the holes are of the requisite dimensions and the material used is strong enough to prevent the holes from being substantially enlarged without visible damage. In addition, it must be impossible to replace the ventilation device by working from one side of the sheet only. 2.2.1 (c)-2 Subparagraph 1 (c), Drainage apertures (a) Their greatest dimension must, in principle, not exceed 35 mm. (b) Apertures permitting direct access to the load compartment must be pirroovided with the devices described in subparagraph (b) of explanatory note 22..22.1. (c)-l for ventilation apertures. (c) When drainage apertures do not permit direct access to the load compartment, the devices referred to in subparagraph (b) of this note will not be prescribed, on condition that the apertures are provided with a reliable baffle system readily accessible from inside the load compartment. 2.3 Article 3 2.3.3 Paragraph 3, Sheets made up of several pieces (a) The several pieces constituting one sheet may be made of different materials conforming to the provisions of annex 2, article 3, paragraph 2. (b) Any arrangement of the pieces which adequately guarantees security will be allowed in making up the sheet, on condition that the pieces are assembled in conformity with the requirements of annex 2, article 3. 2.3.6 (a) Subparagraph 6 (a), Vehicles with sliding rings Metal securing rings sliding on metal bars fixed to the vehicles are acceptable for the purpose of this paragraph (see Sketch No. 2 appended to this annex) provided that: (a) the bars are affixed to the vehicle at maximum spacings of 60 cm and in such a manner that they cannot be removed and replaced without leaving obvious traces; (b) the rings are made with a double hoop or equipped with a central bar and made in one piece without the use of welding; and (c) the sheet is fixed to the vehicle in strict compliance with the  set forth in annex 2, article 1 (a), of this Convention. 2.3.6 (b) Subparagraph 6 (b), Permanently-secured sheets Where one or more edges of the sheet are permanently attached to the body of the vehicle, the sheet shall be held in place by one or more strip[s] of metal or other suitable material secured to the body of the vehicle by joining devices meeting the requirements of subparagraph (a) of note 2.2.1 (a) of this annex. 2.3.9 Paragraph 9, Textile-cored steel fastening ropes For purposes of this paragraph, ropes comprising a textile core surrounded by six strands consisting solely of steel wire and completely covering the core will be allowed on condition that the ropes (without taking into account the transparent plastic sheath, if any) are not less than 3 mm in diameter.

Such flaps, known as tensioning flaps, are used to tauten the sheet by means of tensioning cords or similar devices. Such flaps have been used to conceal horizontal slits made in the sheets giving improper access to the goods carried in the vehicle. It is therefore recommended that the use of flaps of this type should not be allowed. The following devices may be used instead: (a) tensioning flaps of similar design fixed on the inside of the sheet; or (b) small individual flaps each pierced by one eyelet secured to the outside surface of the sheet and spaced at such distances as will permit an adequate tensioning of the sheet. Alternatively, it may be possible in certain cases to avoid the use of tensioning flaps on sheets. 2.3.11 (c) Subparagraph 11 (c), Sheet thongs 2.3.11 (c)-l The following materials are regarded as suitable for making thongs: (a) leather; (b) non-tensile textile materials including plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, provided that such materials cannot after severance be welded or reconstituted without leaving obvious traces. Furthermore, the plastic material used to cover thongs shall be transparent and smooth-surfaced. 2.3.11 (c)-2 The device shown in Sketch No. 3 appended to this annex meets the requirements of the last part of annex 2, article 3, paragraph 11. It also meets the requirements of annex 2, article 3, paragraph 6. 3 ANNEX 3 3.0.17 Approval procedure 1. Annex 3 provides that the competent authorities of a Contracting Party may issue a certificate of approval in respect of a vehicle constructed within its territory and that no additional approval procedures shall be applied in respect of such a vehicle in the country where it is registered or, as the case may be, where the owner is resident. 2. These provisions are not intended to restrict the right of the competent authorities of the Contracting Party where the vehicle is registered or where the owner is resident to require the production of such a certificate of approval either at importation or subsequently for purposes connected with the registration or control of the vehicle or with similar legal requirements. 3.0.20 Procedure for endorsement of the certificate of approval When an endorsement concerning defects is to be cancelled after the vehicle has been restored to a satisfactory state, it is sufficient to state, under Item No. 11 provided for the purpose, \"Defects rectified\" followed by the name, signature and stamp of the competent authority concerned.

REGULATIONS ON TECHNICAL  APPLICABLE TO CONTAINERS WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT UNDER CUSTOMS SEAL Article 1. BASIC PRINCIPLES Approval for the international transport of goods under Customs seal may be granted only to containers constructed and equipped in such a manner that: (a) no goods can be removed from, or introduced into, the sealed part of the container without leaving visible traces of tampering or without breaking the Customs seal; (b) Customs seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them; (c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden; (d) all spaces capable of holding goods are readily accessible for Customs inspection. Article 2. STRUCTURE OF CONTAINERS 1. To meet the requirements of article 1 of these Regulations: (a) The constituent parts of the container (sides, floor, doors, roof, uprights, frames, cross- pieces, etc.) shall be assembled either by means of devices which cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving visible traces or by such methods as will produce a structure which cannot be modified without leaving visible traces. When the sides, floor, doors and roof are made up of various components, these shall meet the same requirements and be of sufficient strength. (b) Doors and all other closing systems (including stopcocks, manhole-covers, flanges, etc.) shall be fitted with a device on which Customs seals can be fixed. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from outside the container without leaving visible traces, or the door or fastening be opened without breaking the Customs seals. The latter shall be adequately protected. Opening roofs shall be permitted. (c) Apertures for ventilation and drainage shall be provided with a device preventing access to the interior of the container. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from outside the container without leaving visible traces. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of article 1 (c) of these Regulations, constituent parts of the container which, for practical reasons, have to include empty spaces (for example, between the partitions of a double wall) shall be permitted. In order that the said spaces cannot be used to conceal goods: (i) it shall not be possible to remove and replace the lining inside the container without leaving visible traces; or (ii) the number of the said spaces shall be kept to a minimum and these spaces shall be readily accessible for Customs inspection. Article 3. CONTAINERS CAPABLE OF BEING FOLDED OR DISMANTLED Containers capable of being folded or dismantled shall be subject to the provisions of articles 1 and 2 of these Regulations; in addition, they shall be fitted with a bolting system which locks the various parts together once the container has been erected. This bolting system must be capable of being sealed by the Customs if it is on the outside of the container when the latter has been erected. Article 4. SHEETED CONTAINERS 1. Where applicable, the provisions of articles 1, 2 and 3 of these Regulations shall apply to sheeted containers. In addition, these containers shall conform to the provisions of this article. Vol. 1079, 1-16510 130______United Nations \u2014 Treaty Series \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s_____1978 2. The sheet shall be either of strong canvas or of plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, which shall be of sufficient strength and unstretchable. It shall be in good condition and made up in such a way that once the closing device has been secured, it is impossible to gain access to the load without leaving visible traces. 3. If the sheet is made up of several pieces, their edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two seams at least 15 mm apart. These seams shall be made as shown in Sketch No. 1 appended to these Regulations; however, where in the case of certain parts of the sheet (such as flaps at the rear and reinforced corners) it is not possible to assemble the pieces in that way, it shall be sufficient to fold the edge of the top section and make the seams as shown in Sketch No. 2 appended to these Regulations. One of the seams shall be visible only from the inside and the colour of the thread used for that seam shall be clearly different from the colour of the sheet itself and from the colour of the thread used for the other seam. All seams shall be machine-sewn. 4. If the sheet is of plastic-covered cloth, and is made up of several pieces, the pieces may alternatively be welded together in the manner shown in Sketch No. 3 appended to these Regulations. The edges of the pieces shall overlap by at least 15 mm. The pieces shall be fused together over the whole width of the overlap. The edge of the outer sheet shall be covered with a band of plastic material at least 7 mm wide, affixed by the same welding process. The plastic band and a width of at least 3 mm on each side shall have a well-marked uniform relief stamped on it. The pieces shall be welded in such a way that they cannot be separated and rejoined without leaving visible traces. 5. Repairs shall be made in accordance witfi the method described in Sketch No. 4 appended to these Regulations; the edges shall be folded iniy one another and sewn together with two visible seams at least 15 mm apart; the colour of the thiead visible from the inside shall be different from that of the thread visible from the outside and from that of the sheet itself; all seams shall be machine-sewn. When a sheet which has been damaged near the edges is repaired by replacing the damaged part by a patch, the seam can also be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this article and Sketch No. 1 appended to these Regulations. Sheets of plastic-covered cloth may alternatively be repaired in accordance with the method described in paragraph 4 of this article, but in that case the weld must be made on both sides of the sheet, the patch being fitted on the inside of the sheet. 6. (a) The sheet shall be fixed to the container in strict compliance with the  set forth in article 1, (a) and (b), of these Regulations. The following types of fastening shall be provided: (i) metal rings fixed to the container; (ii) eyelets in the edge of the sheet; (iii) a fastening passing through the rings above the sheet and visible from the outside for its entire length. The sheet shall overlap solid parts of the container by at least 250 mm, measured from the centre of the securing rings, unless the system of construction of the container by itself prevents all access to the goods. (b) When the edge of a sheet is to be permanently secured to a container, the joint shall be continuous and effected by means of solid devices. 7. The interval between rings and between eyelets shall not exceed 200 mm. The eyelets shall be reinforced. 8. The following fastenings shall be used: (a) steel wire rope of at least 3 mm diameter; or (b) a rope of hemp or sisal of at least 8 mm diameter encased in a transparent unstretchable plastic sheath. Wire ropes may have a transparent unstretchable plastic sheath. 9. Each rope shall be in one piece and have a hard metal end-piece at each end. The fastener of each metal end-piece shall include a hollow rivet passing through the rope so as to allow the introduction of the thread or the strap of the Customs seal. The rope shall remain visible on either side of the hollow rivet so that it is possible to ensure that the rope is in one piece (see Sketch No. 5 appended to these Regulations).

At the openings in the sheet, used for  and un, the two edges of the sheet shall have an adequate overlap. They shall also be fastened by: (a) a flap sewn or welded in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article; (b) rings and eyelets meeting the  of paragraph 7 of this article; and (c) a thong made of appropriate material, in one piece and unstretchable, at least 20 mm wide and 3 mm thick, passing through the rings and holding together the two edges of the sheet and the flap; the thong shall be secured inside the sheet and fitted with an eyelet to take the rope mentioned in paragraph 8 of this article. A flap shall not be required if a special device, such as a baffle plate, is fitted, which prevents access to the goods without leaving visible traces. 11. The identification marks, which must appear on the container, and the approval plate provided for in part II of this annex, shall in no circumstances be covered by the sheet. Article 5. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS Until 1 January 1977, end-pieces shall be allowed which conform to Sketch No. 5 appended to these Regulations, even if they include hollow rivets of a type previously accepted with holes of dimensions less than those given in the sketch.

PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROVAL OF CONTAINERS COMPLYING WITH THE TECHNICAL  PRESCRIBED IN PART I General 1. Containers may be approved for the transport of goods under Customs seal either: (a) at the manufacturing stage, by design type (procedure for approval at the manufacturing stage); or (b) at a stage subsequent to manufacture, either individually or in respect of a specified number of containers of the same type (procedure for approval at a stage subsequent to manufacture). Provisions common to both approval procedures 2. The competent authority responsible for granting approval shall issue to the applicant, after approval, a certificate of approval valid, as the case may be, either for an unlimited series of containers of the approved type of for a specified number of containers. 3. The beneficiary of approval shall affix an approval plate to the approved container or containers before their use for the transport of goods under Customs seal. 4. The approval plate shall be affixed permanently and in a clearly visible place adjacent to any other approval plate issued for official purposes. 5. The approval plate, conforming to Model No. I reproduced in appendix 1 to this part, shall take the form of a metal plate measuring not less than 20 cm by 10 cm. The following particulars shall be stamped into or embossed on the plate or indicated on its surface in any other permanent and legible way, in at least the English or the French language: (a) the words \"Approved for transport under Customs seal\"; (b) an indication of the country in which approval was granted either by name or by means of the distinguishing sign used to indicate the country of registration of motor vehicles in international road traffic, and the number (figures, letters, etc.) of the certificate of approval and the year (e.g., \"NL/26/73\" means \"Netherlands, Certificate of Approval No. 26, issued in 1973\"); (c) the serial number assigned to the container by the manufacturer (manufacturer's number); (d) if the container has been approved by type, the identification numbers or letters of the type of container. 6. If a container no longer complies with the technical  prescribed for its approval, it shall, before it can be used for the transport of goods under Customs seal, be restored to the condition which had justified its approval, so as to comply again with the said technical . 7. If the essential characteristics of a container are changed, the container shall cease to be covered by the approval and shall be reapproved by the competent authority before it can be used for the transport of goods under Customs seal. Special provisions for approval by design type at the manufacturing stage 8. Where the containers are manufactured by type series, the manufacturer may apply to the competent authority of the country of manufacture for approval by design type. 9. The manufacturer shall state in his application the identification numbers or letters which he assigns to the type of container to which his application for approval relates. 10. The application shall be accompanied by drawings and a detailed design specification of the container type to be approved. 11. The manufacturer shall give an undertaking in writing that he will: (a) produce to the competent authority such containers of the type concerned as that authority may wish to examine; (b) permit the competent authority to examine further units at any time during the production of the type series concerned; (c) advise the competent authority of any change, of whatever magnitude, in the design or specification before proceeding with such change; Vol. 1079, I-165IO 138______United Nations \u2014 Treaty S\u00e9ries \u2022 Nations Unies \u2014 Recueil des Trait\u00e9s_____1978 (d) mark th\u00e9 containers in a visible place with, in addition to the markings required on the approval plate, the identification numbers or letters of the design type and the serial number of the container in the type series (manufacturer's number); (<?) keep a record of containers manufactured to the approved design type. 12. The competent authority shall state what changes, if any, must be made to the proposed design type so that approval may be granted. 13. No type-approval by design type shall be granted unless the competent authority has satisfied itself by examination of one or more containers manufactured to the design type concerned that containers of that type comply with the technical  prescribed in part I. 14. When a container type is approved there shall be issued to the applicant a single certificate of approval conforming to Model No. II reproduced in appendix 2 to this part and valid for all containers manufactured in conformity with the specifications of the type so approved. Such certificate shall entitle the manufacturer to affix to every container of the type series an approval plate in the form prescribed in paragraph 5 of this part. Special provisions for approval at a stage subsequent to manufacture 15. If approval has not been applied for at the manufacturing stage, the owner, the operator, or the representative of either, may apply for approval to the competent authority to which he is able to produce the container or containers and for which he seeks approval. 16. An application for approval submitted under paragraph 15 of this part shall state the serial number (manufacturer's number) placed on each container by the manufacturer. 17. When the competent authority has ascertained that the container or containers comply with the technical  prescribed in part I, by examination of as many containers as it considers necessary, it shall issue a certificate of approval conforming to Model No. Ill reproduced in appendix 3 to this part and valid solely for the number of containers approved. Such certificate, which shall bear the manufacturer's serial number or numbers assigned to the container or containers to which it relates, shall entitle the applicant to affix to each container so approved the approval plate prescribed in paragraph 5 of this part.

Commercial Tenants shall pay the rate per square foot of the building footprint area. However, if the Leased Area of any lease includes a Fuel system, the total area required for the Fuel system, inclusive of regulatory setbacks, shall be included in the calculation of the Facility Acquisition Fee. If, using the calculation above, the Facility Acquisition Fee would be less than the Administration Fee for a standard assignment set forth in Chart F of the attached Rent and Fee Schedule, then the Tenant must pay the amount of the Administration Fee for a standard assignment, rather than the amount calculated. The Facility Acquisition Fee will apply to a lease transfer under the \u201cTransfer\u201d section, as amended, of lease forms entered into after January 1, 2008, and will apply to any assignment of the lease, for any reason, with or without consideration, including: Page 8 of 15 Ordinance No. 131 Reliever Airports Rates and Charges Ordinance Effective January 1, 2025 \u2022 A change of ownership or voting control, including a change in the name(s) on the lease, where there is a change of 50% or more (e.g., if only one name is on the lease, and that party wishes to add an additional name, a 50% change would occur, and the fee would apply); \u2022 A transfer for estate-planning purposes (e.g., into a trust), or as a result of death; \u2022 A change in name(s) (e.g., as a result of divorce), where the disposition change is a result of a court order, and there is a change of 50% or more; \u2022 A transfer as part of a bankruptcy; or \u2022 A transfer through a contract for deed. 6.2 Exception The Facility Acquisition Fee will not apply in the following situation: \u2022 A transfer to an Immediate Family Member, including a transfer to an Immediate Family Member for estate-planning purposes (e.g., into a family trust), or a transfer to an Immediate Family Member as a result of death. SECTION 7 \u2013 ADMINISTRATION FEE 7.1 Applicability An Administration Fee, as set forth in Chart F of the attached Rent and Fee Schedule, shall be paid by a Tenant or prospective Tenant, except Military Tenants, for costs associated with the review and processing of lease requests and transactions.

Commission staff shall determine the type of lease request or transaction and the corresponding Administration Fee. 7.2 Additional Amounts Commission staff may charge an additional amount, sufficient to cover its costs, if the costs associated with the review and processing of a lease request or transaction exceed the amount of the Administration Fee, such as for a transaction involving significant legal work. If the Commission assumes the responsibility for issuing building permits in the future, the Commission reserves the right to charge an additional amount, sufficient to cover the costs of the permitting process.

      "content": "Interline Baggage Trade \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions 1. What are the interline baggage rules? IATA Resolution 302 uses the concept of the \u201cMost Significant Carrier\u201d (MSC) to determine whose baggage rules to apply to interline itineraries. For itineraries to or from a point in the United States, the United States Department of Transportation (US DoT) has mandated a different set of rules. For non-US international itineraries, the MSC baggage allowance and charges apply for each flight onto which baggage is through-checked, which is from when the baggage is checked in until it is picked up at the next stopping point. A step-by-step process can be used to determine the MSC \u2013 refer to Question 2: For journeys to or from a point in the United States refer to Question 5, as different rules apply. 2. How is the Most Significant Carrier (MSC) identified? The following table will assist in determining the MSC on an interline journey: 3. What are the IATA Tariff Conference areas? IATA divides the world into three Tariff Conference areas. Each Tariff Conference area is subdivided into sub-areas. These areas and sub-areas are used to determine which carrier\u2019s baggage rules will apply, as demonstrated in the examples below. IATA Area IATA Sub-Area Area 1 (TC1) USA, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean Islands, Central America and South America Area 2 (TC2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa Area 3 (TC3) South Asian Subcontinent, South East Asia, South West Pacific and Japan/Korea Interline Baggage \u2013 Trade FAQs \u2013 version 1.0 Page 1 of 6 Example 1 \u2013 Travel between two different Tariff Conference areas Sector IATA Tariff Conference Area SYD QF HKG (no stop-over) Within TC3 HKG CX LON TC3 to TC2 Cathay Pacific (CX) is the Most Significant Carrier as it is the first carrier to cross between two different Tariff Conference areas TC3 and TC2. Example 2 \u2013 Travel between sub-areas, within the same Tariff Conference area Sector IATA Tariff Conference Area TYO JL HKG (no stop-over) Within TC3. Sub-area: Japan/Korea to South East Asia HKG QF PER Within TC3. Sub-area: South East Asia to South West Pacific Travel is within the same Tariff Conference area TC3. Japan Airlines (JL) is the Most Significant Carrier as it is the first carrier to cross from sub-area Japan/Korea to sub-area South East Asia. Example 3 \u2013 Travel within a sub-area, within the same Tariff Conference area Sector IATA Tariff Conference Area BNE QF AKL (no stopover) Within TC3. Within sub-area South West Pacific AKL NZ WLG Within TC3. Within sub-area South West Pacific Interline Baggage \u2013 Trade FAQs \u2013 version 1.0 Page 2 of 6 Travel is within the same Tariff Conference area of TC3 and within the same sub-area of South West Pacific. Qantas (QF) is the Most Significant Carrier as it is the first international carrier within the same sub-area. 4. What baggage allowance applies if the MSC is a codeshare flight? Under all Qantas codeshare arrangements the marketing carrier\u2019s baggage allowance applies. The QF allowances vary for some QF marketed codeshare routes \u2013 see qantas.com/baggage for details. For non-US itineraries where the Operating Carrier accepts excess baggage, it may apply its own charges for the carriage of that excess baggage. In case of codeshare flights where the ultimate ticketed origin or destination is in the United States, then the first marketing carrier in the itinerary determines the baggage policy to be applied for the whole itinerary (see question 5). 5. What are the baggage rules mandated by the United States Department of Transportation (US DoT)? The US DoT has introduced baggage rules which govern travel to, from, and within the United States including where the ultimate ticketed destination is within the United States \u2013 refer to Questions 6 and 11. (cid:2) The rules state that the baggage allowances and fees that apply at the beginning of a passenger\u2019s itinerary must be applied throughout the entire itinerary. (cid:2) The baggage allowance and fees are determined by the first marketing carrier in the itinerary. Refer to Question 9. (cid:2) Carriers must include the information about the passenger\u2019s free baggage allowance and any applicable fees for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag on the e-ticket. (cid:2) The applicable baggage allowance and charges must also be disclosed to consumers in the prescribed manner on any US-marketed website. For the purposes of determining baggage erules, \"United States\" or \"US\" consists of the continental United States (country code US) and US Territories Guam (GU), Puerto Rico (PR), Virgin Islands (VI), Wake Islands (WI), and Kiribati including Canton and Gilbert Island (KI). 6. What does \u201cultimate ticketed destination\u201d mean? The US DoT defines the ultimate ticketed destination as a stop of more than 24 hours at the farthest point from the origin. The distance is determined by the Ticketed Point Mileage (TPM) from origin to all stopover points on the ticket, in the direction of travel. Fare construction points, side trips and end-on-end fares will not determine how baggage rules are applied. 7. When are the US DoT changes effective from? The US DoT\u2019s baggage rules have been in force since 24 January 2012. In relation to interline and codeshare itineraries, the United States DoT gave carriers and agents until 24 July 2012 to comply with the rules. Substantial fines apply. 8. How do the US DoT rules affect Travel Agents? Travel Agents are also required to comply with the US DoT\u2019s rules in relation to baggage. (cid:2) For passengers whose ticketed origin, destination or where the farthest 24 hour stopover point from origin is a point within the US, Travel Agents must apply the same baggage policy throughout the entire itinerary. This is the baggage policy nominated by the first marketing carrier on the itinerary (refer to Questions 9 and 10). Interline Baggage \u2013 Trade FAQs \u2013 version 1.0 Page 3 of 6 (cid:2) All e-tickets for travel to or from a point in the US must include the passenger\u2019s free baggage allowance and/or the applicable fee for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag. Travel Agents may provide this information through a hyperlink to the specific information on their own website or the applicable airline\u2019s website. (cid:2) All publicly accessible websites in the US must include on the first screen in which a fare quotation is offered for a specific itinerary selected by a customer, that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and where customers can see those fees. Travel Agents may refer customers to the baggage information on their own website or the applicable airline\u2019s website. As a result of carriers filing their baggage policies, the GDS\u2019s should automatically place the required information on the E-Ticket itinerary receipt. Please ensure that the applicable baggage information is included when you issue E-Tickets. 9. Which carrier\u2019s baggage rules will apply under the US DoT rules? For interline and codeshare itineraries, the first marketing carrier in the itinerary determines the baggage policy which will apply for the entire itinerary. The first marketing carrier has two choices: a. apply their own baggage allowance and charges for the whole itinerary; or b. apply the baggage allowance and charges of the MSC for the whole itinerary (as defined in IATA Resolution 302, see questions 2 and 3). 10. Which rules has Qantas chosen to apply? Where Qantas is the first marketing carrier in an itinerary to or from the United States, Qantas has chosen to defer to the baggage allowance and charges of the MSC for that itinerary. This means when the first flight in the itinerary is a Qantas-marketed flight, all airlines in that itinerary must apply the MSC\u2019s baggage policy throughout the entire itinerary. Examples The examples shown below are for explanatory purposes only. Carriers may change their policies. Refer to the applicable carrier for their current policy..

Do the US DoT\u2019s baggage rules apply for passengers who have a connection or stopover in the United States, but whose ultimate ticketed origin and destination are not in the U.S.? No. The US DoT\u2019s baggage rules apply for passengers whose ultimate ticketed origin or destination is a point within the U.S. They do not apply for passengers whose tickets include a connection or stopover in the U.S. The DoT defines ultimate ticketed destination as a stop of more than 24 hours at the farthest point from the origin. For example, the DoT rules would not apply for a passenger who is travelling SYD-LAX-LHR or SYD-LAX-YVR where the passenger is remaining in LHR or YVR for more than 24 hours. The DoT rules would apply for a passenger who is travelling PER-SIN-LON-NYC-LAX-SYD-PER where the passenger is remaining in NYC or LAX for more than 24 hours. The farthest point from origin is PER-NYC via AT with a TPM of 11515 miles (PER-LON via EH has a lesser TPM of 9023 miles). 12. Do the US DoT rules apply to excess, oversize, and special baggage fees, in addition to standard checked baggage fees? Yes. The same allowance and fees, including excess, oversize and special baggage fees, must apply for the entire itinerary. 13. Under the US DoT rules, can a passenger be charged excess baggage for an additional bag or overweight bag during their journey? For example, if they check in more baggage on the return or after a stopover? If so, which carrier\u2019s excess baggage fees apply? Yes, excess baggage fees may be charged if the passenger exceeds the allowance at any point. The same carrier policy that applied at the beginning of the itinerary must be applied throughout the entire itinerary, including fees for any additional or overweight bag/s. 14. Do the US DoT\u2019s rules apply to carry-on baggage? Yes, the US DoT rules apply to all baggage allowances and fees, including carry-on baggage policies. 15. How can I check which baggage allowance is applicable? Carriers file their baggage allowance and fees via the Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO) and your GDS will automatically populate the applicable baggage allowance into the baggage field of the ticket mask and onto the ticket. For journeys to and from the United States (cid:2) If Qantas is the first marketing carrier in an itinerary, the Most Significant Carrier\u2019s baggage allowance and fees will apply for the itinerary. (cid:2) If Qantas is not the first marketing carrier on the itinerary, Qantas does not determine which baggage policy applies. Please confirm the applicable baggage policy with the first marketing carrier on the itinerary to ensure customers are provided with accurate information. Interline Baggage \u2013 Trade FAQs \u2013 version 1.0 Page 5 of 6 A summary of Qantas and its interline partners\u2019 baggage allowances and any fees for carry on baggage and the first and second checked baggage is available on the US version of the Qantas website at http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/interline-baggage-allowances/global/en 16. Can the baggage allowance on a ticket be manually changed by a Travel Agent? The baggage allowance on a ticket must not be manually adjusted. The GDS will automatically apply the applicable baggage policy for the journey quoted, in accordance with the policies filed by the applicable carriers. If you believe the baggage information is incorrect, please check with the applicable carrier. For US itineraries, this will be the first marketing carrier on the itinerary. For non-US itineraries, the baggage allowance on a ticket may vary for each checked journey a customer will make. This is not an error. Please ensure the customer is aware when different allowances apply. For journeys to, from or within the USA, the baggage allowance will be the same for the entire itinerary and is determined by the first marketing carrier. A summary of Qantas and its interline partners\u2019 baggage allowances and any fees for carry on baggage and the first and second checked baggage is available on the US version of the Qantas website at http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/interline- baggage-allowances/global/en Note: Some fares have special baggage allowances which are specifically stated in the fare rules and apply for the entire journey, for example oneworld Explorer and Global Explorer fares. 17. If a customer holds two tickets issued separately, what rules apply and can the baggage be checked to the final destination? Where a customer chooses to purchase travel separately, the baggage rules are applied separately to determine the applicable allowance and fees for each separately issued ticket. Normally baggage carried on separate tickets will not be through checked. 18. Where can Travel Agents find more information about baggage policies? Further information can be found: (cid:2) Qantas Industry Sales\u2013 Policies and Procedures \u2013 Baggage (cid:2) Qantas.com/baggage (cid:2) Qantas US website baggage and optional services link http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/us-baggage-allowance-and-fees/us/en (cid:2) Your Global Distribution System (GDS) (cid:2) Website or Call Centre of interline airlines Interline Baggage \u2013 Trade FAQs \u2013 version 1.0 Page 6 of 6"

RULE 55 - SERVICE ANIMALS & WORKING DOGS Service Animals Sun Country Airlines will accept for transportation without charge a Service Animal when the Service Animal accompanies the passenger with a disability in the cabin; however, the Service Animal will not be permitted to occupy a seat and must accompany the passenger in the passenger\u2019s lap or in the passenger\u2019s foot space (unless this location and placement would be inconsistent with the safety requirements set by the FAA or encroach into another passenger\u2019s space).

Sun Country Airlines has partnered with Open Doors Organization (ODO), a non-profit disability advocacy group, to streamline the completion of the required U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation form. ODO provides the option to complete the required form online through their Service Animal Forms Portal (SAFP).

The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within a period of two years, reckoned from the data of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date the carriage stopped. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of Sun Country Airlines with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf or in respect to any person who has willfully caused damage which resulted in death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger. Sun Country Airlines shall not be liable for the death or injury of a passenger not occurring on its own operated flights. Updated October 15, 2025 14 Contract of Carriage RULE 100 - TICKETS No person shall be entitled to transportation except upon proof of a valid paid reservation. Such proof shall entitle the passenger to transportation only between points of origin and destination and via the routing designated thereon. Tickets purchased within 48 hours of travel may require the purchasing cardholder to present the purchasing credit card and government issued photo identification for verification at the airport during check-in. The purchaser may need to find alternate ticketing arrangements (i.e. travel agency) if unable to present such credit card at the departing airport at the time of check-in. (See Airport Check-In Time Limit in Rule 135 - Cancellation of Reservations) Abuse or Misuse of Tickets Combining two or more tickets end-to-end for the purpose of circumventing applicable tariff rules (such as advance purchase/minimum stay) is not permitted. Sun Country Airlines passengers, agents and authorized travel agents are prohibited from issuing or purchasing tickets for the use from a point before the passenger's actual origin or to a point beyond the passenger's actual destination, commonly referred to as \"hidden city/point beyond ticketing\". Any practice that Sun Country Airlines believes, in its sole discretion, is exploitative, abusive or that manipulates/bypasses/overrides Sun Country Airline\u2019s fare and ticket rules could additionally be considered a prohibited practice. Agents found to have issued such tickets may be liable for the difference between the fare paid and the fare for transportation used. Sun Country Airlines reserves the right to deny transportation to passengers found to be utilizing tickets in such manner unless the difference between the fare paid and the fare for transportation used is paid by the passenger. Non-Transferable Tickets Sun Country tickets are not transferable. Sun Country shall not be liable to the person entitled to be transported or to the person entitled to a refund for honoring or refunding a ticket when presented by someone other than the person entitled to be transported thereunder or to a refund in connection therewith. If a ticket is in fact used by any person other than the person to whom it was issued, Sun Country Airlines shall not be liable for the destruction, damage or delay of such unauthorized person's baggage or other personal property or the death or injury of such unauthorized persons arising from or in connection with such unauthorized use. Passenger Name on Ticket The purchaser of a Sun Country Airlines ticket and the passenger intending to use such ticket are responsible for ensuring that the ticket accurately states the name of the passenger. Presentation of a ticket for transportation on Sun Country Airlines by someone other than the passenger named thereon renders the ticket void. Such ticket will be subject to confiscation and will be ineligible for any refund. Updated October 15, 2025 15 Contract of Carriage RULE 105 - PERIOD OF VALIDITY Except as provided below, an unused ticket will be valid for rebooking of transportation within one year from the date on which the ticket was purchased; additional fare and Change Fee may apply. Tickets may be changed provided the original reservation is canceled prior to the departure time designated on the original ticket. If the original reservation is not canceled before departure in accordance with Rule 135 - Cancellation of Reservations, the ticket can no longer be applied to a new reservation, all monies are forfeited, and no Flight Credit remains. For the rule applicable to No-Show Passengers, see Rule 135 - Cancellation of Reservations - Failure to Occupy Space. Exception: For tickets issued for fares subject to group travel requirements and/or maximum stay requirements and/or fare rules that call for a shorter period of validity than one (1) year, the shorter period of validity applies to the excursion/special fare transportation only. Extension of Validity In accordance with Rule 240 - Flight Delays/Misconnections/Cancellations/Schedule Change and Rule 260 - Refunds Resulting from Inability to Accommodate or Refusal to Carry Passenger if the passenger is prevented from using the ticket or a portion of the ticket during the period of validity specified above or the period of validity applicable to an excursion or special fare due to lack of space or flight cancellation, the ticket will remain valid until space can be provided on a schedule comparable to that which the passenger had requested. If the passenger is unable to commence or continue travel due to a personal illness, physical incapacity or the illness or physical incapacity of a member of the passenger\u2019s immediate family or of an associate with whom he/she is traveling, the carrier may extend the period of validity beyond the original limit not to exceed thirty (30) days. The illness or incapacity must be certified in writing by a physician specifying that the passenger is prevented from completing the journey before the expiration of the original time limit because of such circumstances. The certificate must be surrendered to the carrier and the ticket and all receipts affected must be endorsed by the agent to indicate that the extension has been granted. Special Fare Provisions The provisions below apply to fares that are subject to group travel requirements and/or reservations or ticketing time limitations and/or minimum or maximum stay requirements. Period of Validity When a ticket includes an excursion or special fare having a shorter period of validity than one (1) year, the shorter period of validity applies only to the excursion or special fare transportation. RULE 115 - CONFIRMATION OF RESERVATIONS A reservation for space on a given flight will be honored when the availability and allocation of such space is confirmed electronically for online bookings or by a reservation agent of Sun Country Airlines or its authorized representative. Subject to payment a validated ticket will be issued indicating such confirmed space. Such reservation is subject to cancellation by Sun Country Airlines without notice if the passenger has not obtained a validated ticket specifying his/her confirmed reserved space at least forty-five (45) minutes prior to the scheduled departure time of the flight to which his/her reservation applies. Updated October 15, 2025 16 Contract of Carriage Exception 1: If the passenger agrees to purchase a validated ticket specifying his/her confirmed reserved space at a time earlier than the time limit specified above, such earlier time limit will be entered into Sun Country Airlines' reservation system. The reservation is subject to cancellation by Sun Country Airlines without notice if the passenger has not obtained a validated ticket specifying confirmed space prior to the agreed time in advance of the scheduled departure of the flight on which passenger has a reservation. Exception 2: Where other rules provide for issuance, validation or purchase of a ticket more than forty-five (45) minutes prior to scheduled departure time of the reserved flight the advance ticketing time limit specified in such other rule will apply Exception 3: Validated tickets shall not be honored if reservations are canceled pursuant to Rule 135 - Cancellation of Reservations or canceled by the passenger or his/her representative. Because not all passengers holding confirmed reservations actually use those reservations, Sun Country Airlines flights are subject to overbooking which may result in Sun Country Airlines\u2019 inability to honor tickets for previously confirmed space on a given flight or for the class of service reserved. In such event, Sun Country Airlines\u2019 obligation to the passenger is governed by Rule 245 - Denied Boarding Compensation. The term \u201coverbooking\u201d as used in this rule means the acceptance of more confirmed reservations for a class of service on a given flight than the seating capacity of that class of service on the aircraft allows. RULE 120 - RESERVATIONS AND TICKETING TIME LIMITS Reservations requested from any Sun Country Airlines office or authorized agency will be accepted by Sun Country Airlines and ticketing time limits may apply. RULE 135 - CANCELLATION OF RESERVATIONS Sun Country Airlines will cancel reservations of any passenger whenever such action is necessary to comply with any governmental regulation or order, or to comply with any governmental request for emergency transportation in connection with the national defense, or as necessitated by weather, pandemics, fuel availability, grounding of an aircraft type, or other  beyond Sun Country Airlines' control. Failure to Occupy Space On the day of travel, all passengers must be checked in either at the airport ticket counter, kiosk, or through the Sun Country Airlines website (www.suncountry.com) and be available for passenger boarding at the departure gate at least thirty (30) minutes (domestic flights) or sixty (60) minutes (international flights) prior to scheduled departure. Failure to do so will subject the reservation(s) to cancellation or to classification of the passenger as a No-Show Passenger as set forth in this contract. Sun Country Airlines will cancel all subsequent flights held by No-Show Passengers on the flights of Sun Country Airlines, including continuing or return flights on the No-Show Passenger's itinerary. Sun Country Airlines will cancel all subsequent flights held by No-Show Passengers on the flights of Sun Country Airlines, including continuing or return flights on the No-Show Passenger's itinerary. A No-Show Passenger will receive an Involuntary Refund of the full amount paid inclusive of all taxes and fees; however, each such passenger will be assessed a no-show fee equal to an amount per passenger per direction (the amount of the fee is available on the Sun Country Airlines website at https://suncountry.com/-and-/changes- Updated October 15, 2025 17 Contract of Carriage cancellations or by calling Sun Country at 651-905-2737), but not to exceed the value of the full amount paid. The no-show fee is not a payment for air transportation but is a separate charge and transaction under this contract; for the convenience of the parties, the no-show fee will be offset against the Involuntary Refund and any remaining amount will be issued to each passenger in the form of a Flight Credit (which shall be valid for one (1) year from the booking date of the flight for which the Flight Credit is being issued, subject to the applicable Change Fee). No-Show Passenger consents to Sun Country Airlines\u2019 claiming of any credit or refund of Section 4261 tax under section 6415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Flight Credit will be available to the passenger by calling Sun Country Airlines reservations. Airport Check-In Time Limit With two exceptions noted below, check-in for Sun Country Airlines flights closes forty-five (45) minutes prior to scheduled departure (domestic flights) and sixty (60) minutes prior to scheduled departure (international flights). It is the passenger's responsibility to arrive at the airport with proper identification and other required documentation, if any, in adequate time to allow for check-in requirements and security processing. Exceptions: The following cities\u2019 ticket counter locations will be closed for check-in as follows: \u2022 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 sixty (60) minutes prior to scheduled departure \u2022 St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 ninety (90) minutes prior to scheduled departure Sun Country Airlines recommends passengers arrive at the airport ticket counter one hundred twenty (120) minutes prior to scheduled departure (domestic flights) and one hundred eighty (180) minutes prior to scheduled departure (international flights). Passengers traveling with battery-powered wheelchairs or other battery-powered mobility devices must present themselves at the departure gate at least one (1) hour prior to scheduled departure. Misconnected Passengers See Rule 240 - Flight Delays/Misconnections/Cancellations/Schedule Change of this contract. Liability Sun Country Airlines is not liable when it cancels the reservations of any passenger in accordance with this rule but: \u2022 If such reservations were canceled by Sun Country Airlines pursuant to the first sentence of Rule 135 \u2013 Cancellation of Reservations or for other reasons not involving the passenger\u2019s fault or per \u201cMisconnected Passengers\u201d above, Sun Country Airlines will take action as provided in Rule 240 - Flight Delays/Misconnections/Cancellations/Schedule Change of this contract. \u2022 If such reservations were canceled pursuant to \u201cAirport Check-In Time Limit\u201d above, Sun Country Airlines will refund in accordance with Rule 270 \u2013 Voluntary Refunds of this contract. \u2022 If such reservation were cancelled for a No-Show Passenger, Sun Country will refund such passenger in accordance with the \u201cFailure to Occupy Space\u201d section above. \u2022 The remedies in the above three bullet points shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available to eligible passengers. Under no circumstances shall any passenger have a claim against Sun Country in law or equity for compensatory or punitive damages, irrespective of whether the passenger did or did not travel. Updated October 15, 2025 18 Contract of Carriage Refusal of Transport Sun Country Airlines may refuse to transport any passenger under any of the rules stated in Rule 35 - Refusals to Transport of this contract. RULE 150 - GENERAL FARES Sun Country Airlines may offer discount, thrift, economy, coach, first class, and such other fare categories as Sun Country may establish. Fares are subject to change without notice. Details may be obtained from Sun Country Airlines. Fares apply for transportation only between the airports for which they are published. Tickets may neither be issued nor accepted for transportation that will either originate or terminate at an airport other than the airport for which the fares are published.

In delivering baggage or other property to Sun Country Airlines for transportation, whether checked or otherwise placed into the custody of Sun Country Airlines or one of its employees, the fare-paying passenger agrees that Sun Country Airlines' liability, if any, should the baggage be lost, damaged or delayed in delivery is limited to the lesser of the amount of provable direct and consequential damages actually sustained by the passenger or $4,700 for domestic flights. In the case of such flights, the damage sustained by the passenger for property that is lost shall be measured by the fair market value of the property at the time it was received by Sun Country Airlines and not by the cost to replace the property. These limitations on Sun Country Airlines' liability also apply to baggage or other personal property in Sun Country Airlines' possession at a city or airport office or elsewhere before or after the passenger's flight. Interline Travel For U.S. domestic interline travel when the airlines involved have different limitations of liability, and responsibility for loss, damage or delay in delivery of baggage cannot be determined, the $4,700 limit of liability will apply when the claim is filed with Sun Country Airlines.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Rule 230 \u2013 Baggage Liability Limitations, for international flights, Sun Country Airlines is not liable only if and to the extent that damage resulted from an inherent defect, quality, or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, Sun Country is liable only if the damage resulted from Sun Country\u2019s fault. For purposes of baggage handling and liability, unless a passenger provides contrary evidence, all checked baggage will be treated as the property of the individual who checked it. Each item of baggage shall be considered the property of one passenger only. RULE 240 - FLIGHT DELAYS/MISCONNECTIONS/CANCELLATIONS/SCHEDULE CHANGE DELAY, MISCONNECTION OR CANCELLATION Sun Country will have no liability for delays, misconnections, or cancellations. Without limiting the foregoing, \u2022 If Sun Country is unable to provide alternative transportation acceptable to the passenger subject to a Significantly Delayed or Changed Flight, Sun Country will refund the value of the unused air transportation in accordance with Rule 260 - Refunds Resulting from Inability to Accommodate or Refusal to Carry Passenger, which will be the limit of its liability. \u2022 If the passenger is holding a confirmed seat on a higher-class ticket and space is only available on a lower class of seating, Sun Country will refund the difference in fares pursuant to Rule 260 - Refunds Resulting from Inability to Accommodate or Refusal to Carry Passenger. \u2022 In no event will Sun Country reimburse a passenger for travel purchased from another carrier. Schedule Change Sun Country may, without liability and without notice, change the time of the schedule of any flight, substitute aircraft, add or omit scheduled stops. With or without such changes, Sun Country does not guarantee that passengers will make connections to other flights operated by it or another carrier. If Sun Country is unable to provide alternative transportation acceptable to the passenger subject to a Significantly Delayed or Changed Flight, Sun Country will refund the value of the unused air transportation in accordance with Rule 260 - Refunds Resulting from Inability to Accommodate or Refusal to Carry Passenger, which will be the limit of its liability. Updated October 15, 2025 36 Contract of Carriage Amenities When a fare-paying passenger holds confirmed reservations on a Sun Country Airlines flight, Sun Country Airlines may assume limited expenses incurred as a result of a mechanical delay which was reasonably within the control of Sun Country Airlines and exceeded four (4) hours for domestic flights or eight (8) hours for international flights, provided however, that any such limited expenses shall only be reimbursable by Sun Country Airlines if the impacted passenger provides itemized receipts. Sun Country Airlines will advise the passenger of the available amenities and services. Sun Country Airlines may provide special amenities and services which, in Sun Country Airlines\u2019 judgment, are required by certain passengers such as passengers with disabilities, or ill and/or incapacitated passengers for the safety, health and welfare of such passengers. Carriers in Default Sun Country Airlines will not accept for any purposes under this Contract of Carriage passenger tickets or related transportation documents issued by any carrier which is in substantial default of its interline obligations or which voluntarily or involuntarily has become the subject of bankruptcy proceedings (the \u201cdefaulting carrier\u201d). Exception: Tickets issued by the defaulting carrier or its sales agent prior to the default will be accepted solely for transportation on Sun Country Airlines provided such tickets were issued by such defaulting carrier in its capacity as agent for Sun Country Airlines and specified transportation via Sun Country Airlines. When such tickets are accepted, no adjustments in fare will be made which would require Sun Country Airlines to refund money to the passenger. Strike/Work Stoppage In the event of a work stoppage which causes any cancellation or suspension of operations of any carrier other than Sun Country, the provisions of this rule will not apply with respect to passengers holding tickets for transportation on that carrier. RULE 245 - DENIED BOARDING COMPENSATION If you have been denied a reserved seat on Sun Country Airlines, you are probably entitled to monetary compensation. This notice explains Sun Country Airlines\u2019 obligations and the passenger\u2019s rights in the case of an oversold flight, in accordance with regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Volunteers and Boarding Priorities If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against his or her will until Sun Country Airlines personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly, in exchange for compensation of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the boarding priorities of Sun Country Airlines. In such event, Sun Country Airlines will usually deny boarding based upon check-in time (i.e., the last passenger to check in would be the first to be denied boarding), but Sun Country may also consider factors such as severe hardships, fare paid, and status with Sun Country Rewards. Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate individuals with a disability or Updated October 15, 2025 37 Contract of Carriage needing assistance, the elderly, connecting passengers, families traveling with children, and passengers less than eighteen (18) years of age.

Amount of Denied Boarding Compensation Domestic Transportation Passengers traveling between points within the United States (including its territories and possessions) that are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight are entitled to: \u2022 No compensation if Sun Country Airlines offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight; \u2022 200% of the fare to the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover, or $1,075, whichever is lower, if Sun Country Airlines offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight; and \u2022 400% of the fare to the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover, or $2,150, whichever is lower, if Sun Country Airlines does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight. 0 to 1 hour arrival delay: No compensation 1 to 2 hour arrival delay: 200% of one-way fare, or $1,075, whichever is lower Over 2 hours arrival delay: 400% of one-way fare, or $2,150, whichever is lower International Transportation Passengers traveling from the United States to a foreign point who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight originating at a U.S. airport are entitled to: Updated October 15, 2025 38 Contract of Carriage \u2022 No compensation if Sun Country Airlines offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight; \u2022 200% of the fare to the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover, or $1,075, whichever is lower, if Sun Country Airlines offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight; and \u2022 400% of the fare to the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover, or $2,150,whichever is lower, if Sun Country Airlines does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger\u2019s destination or first stopover less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger\u2019s original flight. 0 to 1 hour arrival delay: No compensation 1 to 4 hour arrival delay: 200% of one-way fare, or $1,075, whichever is lower Over 4 hours arrival delay: 400% of one-way fare, or $2,150, whichever is lower Alternate Transportation \u201cAlternate transportation\u201d is air transportation with a confirmed reservation at no additional charge (by any scheduled airline licensed by DOT), or other transportation accepted and used by the passenger in the case of denied boarding.

Sun Country Airlines may offer free or discounted transportation in place of the cash payment. In that event, Sun Country Airlines will disclose all material restrictions on the use of the free or discounted transportation before the passenger decides whether to accept the transportation in lieu of a cash or check payment. The passenger may insist on the cash/check payment or refuse all compensation and bring private legal action. Acceptance of denied boarding compensation relieves Sun Country Airlines from any further liability to the passenger caused by its failure to honor the confirmed reservation.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: A. Background In 2014, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) titled \u201cTransparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees and Other Consumer Protection issues.\u201d 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014). In the 2014 NPRM, the Department proposed to enhance consumer protections through various means, including the disclosure of certain airline ancillary service fees. In 2017, noting the significant comments received regarding the proposal on ancillary service fees in the 2014 NPRM, the Department issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) titled \u201cTransparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees.\u201d 82 FR 7536 (Jan. 19, 2017). In the 2017 SNPRM, the Department proposed to require fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag be disclosed at all points of sale wherever fare and schedule information is provided to consumers. The Department further proposed that carriers1 distribute 1 The Department uses the term \u201ccarrier\u201d or \u201cairline\u201d to refer to air carriers and foreign air carriers, as such  are defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(2) and (a)(21). 3 useable, current, and accurate fee information to ticket agents that receive and distribute the carrier\u2019s fare and schedule information, including Global Distribution Systems (GDS). The Department also proposed that the information provided by carriers be detailed enough to allow ticket agents to disclose fees as itinerary-specific or customer-specific (i.e., fees that are differentiated based on factors specific to the passenger or proposed itinerary) charges. However, the SNPRM did not propose to require that consumers be able to purchase these ancillary services through ticket agents (i.e., did not propose transactability). The Department withdrew the SNPRM on December 14, 2017. In the Notice of Withdrawal of Proposed Rulemaking, 82 FR 58778 (Dec. 14, 2017), the Department stated that its existing requirements provide consumers information regarding fees for ancillary services and noted that the withdrawal was consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which has since been revoked.2 On July 9, 2021, the President issued E.O. 14036, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d which launched a whole-of-government approach to strengthen competition. E.O. 14036 includes 72 initiatives by more than a dozen Federal agencies to promptly tackle some of the most pressing competition problems across our economy. It directed the Department to take various actions to foster competition and promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers. Specifically, section 5, paragraph(m)(i)(F) of E.O. 14036 states: The Secretary of Transportation shall: . . . not later than 90 days after the date of this order, consider initiating a rulemaking to ensure that consumers have ancillary fee information, 2 President Biden issued E.O. 13992, \u201cRevocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation,\u201d on January 20, 2021, which revoked E.O. 13771 and certain other Executive Orders. 4 including \u201cbaggage fees,\u201d \u201cchange fees,\u201d and \u201ccancellation fees,\u201d at the time of ticket purchase. This rulemaking implements section 5, paragraph(m)(i)(F) of E.O. 14036.3 B. Need for a Rulemaking The Department regularly receives input from stakeholder groups, including airlines and consumer advocacy groups, regarding air transportation-related concerns. Consumer advocates have consistently stated to the Department that there is a market failure in air transportation pricing because consumers are unable to determine the true cost of air travel prior to ticket purchase. They have also raised concerns about the lack of competition in the industry. The Department\u2019s full fare rule in 14 CFR 399.84 is designed to ensure the price stated is the entire price required to be paid by the consumer for air transportation. In the context of the full fare rule, air transportation is the transport of the passenger on an aircraft from one location to another location and includes all charges the passenger must pay for this service. The existing regulation does not require that the full fare quoted include the many kinds of ancillary fees consumers may pay for optional services. Consumer advocates have asserted that a lack of passenger specific information regarding fees for ancillary services at the time of ticket purchase is causing a market failure by limiting the ability of consumers to understand the true cost of the travel that they are looking to purchase and to compare pricing between carriers and travel options. Many services or products traditionally included in the price of an airline ticket such as checked baggage and meals are now sold separately. Ancillary service means any optional 3 This rulemaking also addresses section 5, paragraph (m)(i)(B) of E.O.14036. That section directed the Department to promote enhanced transparency and consumer safeguards, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including through potential rulemaking, enforcement actions, or guidance documents, with the aims of enhancing consumer access to airline flight information so that consumers can more easily find a broader set of available flights, including by new or lesser known airlines; and ensuring that consumers are not exposed or subject to advertising, marketing, pricing, and charging of ancillary fees that may constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition. 5 service related to air travel provided by a carrier, for a fee, beyond passenger air transportation. Such service includes, but is not limited to, checked or carry-on baggage, ticket change and cancellation, advance seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment program, and in-flight beverages, snacks, or meals. Certain members of Congress and State governments representing constituents have expressed support for full, more specific, disclosure of ancillary service fees. Certain members of Congress have also sponsored legislation on this topic.4 Further, the Joint Explanatory Statement of the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act requested that the Department work in collaboration with industry, consumers and other stakeholders to establish guidelines on transparency of airline ancillary fees.5 Subsequently, the Department tasked the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) with examining this issue.6 The ACPAC heard from several consumer advocacy groups, including Travelers United, the National Consumers League, and the Global Business Travel Association regarding this issue. Consumer organizations that presented to the ACPAC stressed the importance of ensuring consumers can accurately and easily compare travel costs, inclusive of ancillary fees, and they recommended 4 See, e.g., Letter from Representative Nita M. Lowey to Secretary Elaine Chao (Dec. 8, 2017) and Letter from Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and attorneys general from 15 other states and the District of Columbia to Secretary Elaine L.

In 2010, the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee advised generally that DOT \u201cshould ensure transparency in air carrier pricing, including ancillary fees.\u201d9 In 2012, the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection adopted this recommendation and added that all participants in the airfare and fee distribution system should be guided by principles of transparency, providing choices and offers that meet consumer needs, and knowing the full price before purchase.10 Then in 2015, the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection recommended that DOT require change/cancellation fees be clear and displayed before ticket purchase.11 Consumer advocates had asserted that such fees had become significant and difficult to ascertain.12 7 See Summary of April 4, 2019 ACPAC Meeting 10\u201316, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT- OST-2018-0190-0019; see also Summary of September 24, 2020 ACPAC Meeting 19\u201320, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0025. 8 Report of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee 5 (Dec. 31, 2020), available at https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/acpac-report-secretary-transportation- december-31-2020 9 The Future of Aviation Advisory Committee, Final Report 36 (Apr. 11, 2011), available at https://www.transportation.gov/highlights/future-aviation-advisory-committee/faac-final-report 10 Report of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 7\u20138 (Oct. 22, 2012), available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/1st-ACACP-Report-22OCT2012. 11 Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3 (Sept. 1, 2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACACP/9th-meeting-Sept-1/record. 12 See Record of Meeting, Eighth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection 3\u20135 (June 23, 2015), available at https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/resources/individuals/aviation- consumer-protection/285976/acacp-record-8th-meeting-23june2015.pdf; see also Record of Meeting, Ninth Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Aviation Consumer Protection (Sept. 1, 2015). 7 Most recently, in June 2022, the ACPAC again addressed the issue of transparency of airline ancillary service fees.13 During the meeting, DOT solicited comment on the key topics of this NPRM (namely, which ancillary service fees are critical for consumers, airlines sharing data regarding critical ancillary service fees with ticket agents, and how to best display this information to consumers). DOT also solicited comment on whether fees for certain ancillary services should be disclosed at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed. Consumer advocates expressed the view that because most passengers travel once per year or less, they may not be aware of certain ancillary service fees, such as those related to seat selection.14 Advocates also argued that the practice of \u201cdrip pricing,\u201d in which sellers advertise a portion of the full price and then reveal additional charges over time tends to lock consumers into engaging with a given seller, and reduces competition, because the customer has invested time and energy into the purchasing process and thus is less likely to abandon the purchase entirely and re-institute a fuller search for options.15 This NPRM builds on the Department\u2019s final rule in 2011 regarding the disclosure of ancillary service fees by carriers and ticket agents. The 2011 final rule requires carriers to list on their website all ancillary service fees on a page that is directly linked from their main websites. The Department allows carriers to display the fees for ancillary services in a range, except for 13 See https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting. A webcast of the meeting is available to view on the ACPAC web site. Speakers\u2019 materials have been posted to the ACPAC docket at www.regulations.gov; docket DOT-OST-2018-0190. On the second day of the meeting, the ACPAC addressed the separate but related issue of availability of airline flight information. 14 Presentation of FlyersRights, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0046. 15 Id.; see also Presentation of American Antitrust Institute, available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 morning session), and Federal Trade Commission, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HOTEL RESORT FEES, (Jan. 2017), available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/economic-analysis-hotel-resort- fees/p115503_hotel_resort_fees_economic_issues_paper.pdf. 8 baggage information. For baggage, the Department requires that carriers provide specific baggage fee information to enable the consumer to determine the cost of the baggage. In addition, carriers and ticket agents are required to disclose, upon displaying the result of an itinerary search, that baggage fees may apply and refer the consumer to the location on the airlines\u2019 or ticket agents\u2019 website where the consumer can review baggage fee information to determine the fees that would apply to him or her. While the Department considers the disclosure requirements in its 2011 final rule to be a step in the right direction, based on feedback from consumer advocacy groups and others since publication of the 2011 final rule, DOT has determined that these requirements were insufficient and did not fully provide transparency of ancillary services and products. Since the issuance of the 2011 final rule, consumer advocacy organizations have regularly reported to the Department that consumers often find the process of determining the baggage fees that apply to them to be a complicated and time-consuming process. In 2019, during a meeting of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee, two consumer organizations underscored the difficulties faced by consumers in determining the total cost of air travel.16 Consumer advocates maintain that consumers are confused by the complex charts that carriers and ticket agents provide to consumers to determine their baggage fees. In September 2017, GAO noted that consumer group representatives stated that it has become \u201cincreasingly difficult for consumers to compare airfare ticket prices, fees, and associated rules, and understand what is included in their purchases.\u201d17 In December 2017, after the Department 16 See Summary of April 4, 2019 ACPAC Meeting 11-13, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT- OST-2018-0190-0019. 17 GAO 17-756, Commercial Aviation: Information on Airline Fees for Optional Services (September 2017), p. 33 at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-756.pdf. 9 withdrew its January 2017 SNPRM on Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees, a coalition of 16 States\u2019 attorney generals urged the Department to reverse its decision, stating that they \u201cregularly hear reports from consumers in [their] states who are confused and frustrated by these fees, which significantly alter the total cost of travel.\u201d18 The Department also receives consumer complaints that reflect the confusion consumers experience regarding fees for baggage. Further, consumer advocates contend that the ancillary services and fees that airlines post on their websites are not useful to consumers to determine the cost of travel because airlines generally provide a range of fees for ancillary services aside from baggage. Airlines acknowledge that the fees for ancillary services often vary based on various factors such as the type of aircraft used, the flight on which a passenger is booked, or the time at which a passenger pays for the service or product. The requirements to provide specific baggage fee information and a range of fees for other ancillary services have not been as helpful to consumers in determining the true cost of travel as the Department had anticipated when issuing its final rule in 2011. The Department receives hundreds of consumer complaints each year regarding change fees, cancellation fees,19 and seating fees.20 The complaints regarding seating fees have included complaints from consumers who state that they were not provided seats next to their young child on a flight. Congress instructed the Department to review airline seating policies and consider 18 Letter from Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and attorneys general from 15 other states and the District of Columbia to Secretary Elaine L. Chao (Dec. 20, 2017). 19 OACP received over 550 complaints regarding change and cancellation fees in 2021. The Department has not determined what share of these complaints are from individuals who were unaware of the fees or unable to find information on the fees and what share was from individuals who generally did not like having to pay a fee. 20 OACP received over 140 complaints regarding seat fees in 2021. The Department has not determined what share of these complaints are from individuals who were unaware of the fees or unable to find information on the fees and what share was from individuals who generally did not like having to pay a fee. 10 establishing a policy directing airlines to have policies to enable children who are 13 years of age or younger to sit with a family member over the age of 13 at no additional cost.21 In July 2022, the Department issued a \u201cNotice Encouraging U.S. Airlines to Have Policies That Enable Children to Be Seated Adjacent to an Accompanying Adult to the Maximum Extent Practicable and at No Additional Cost.\u201d22 In the notice, the Department provides that airlines should do everything that they can to ensure the ability of parents to sit next to their young children, including allowing every young child to sit next to a parent without charging fees for adjacent seating. It is also worth noting that consumer comments in the 2014 NPRM strongly supported Department action on disclosure of ancillary service fees.23 Based on a review of consumer complaints, comments received in the 2014 NPRM, feedback received from consumer advocacy organizations, and the work of various advisory committees, the Department believes that many consumers continue to be unsatisfied with the level of disclosures they receive regarding ancillary service fees. The Department believes, based on a review of consumer complaints and discussions at past advisory committee meetings, that the current disclosure requirements are not sufficient. It is difficult for consumers to determine the best and most cost-effective flights when fee information for essential services such as ticket changes or cancellations, family seating, or baggage is not readily available. There is a need for a rulemaking on transparency of airline ancillary fees to address difficulties that consumers have 21 See 49 U.S.C. 42301 note prec. (Section 2309 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016, P.L. 114- 190 (July 15, 2016)). 22 See https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/family-seating/June-2022-notice . 23 See comments submitted in the 79 FR 29970 (May 23, 2014). The docket for the 2014 NPRM, which can be accessed at https://www.regulations.gov/search?filter=DOT-OST-2014-0056. See also 82 FR 7536, 7537 (Jan. 19, 2017) describing comments received in 2014 NPRM as \u201cOver 450 consumers clearly supported additional requirements relating to disclosure of ancillary service fees while fewer than ten commented in opposition to additional disclosure requirements.\u201d 11 in finding ancillary service fee information, which limits consumers\u2019 ability to determine the true cost of travel and to adequately compare airline pricing. In issuing this rulemaking, the Department intends to protect consumers from hidden and deceptive fees and enable them to determine the true cost of travel in an effective and efficient manner when they price shop for air transportation. C. Statutory Authority The Department is issuing this rulemaking pursuant to its statutory authority in 49 U.S.C. 41712 to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation and the sale of air transportation. A practice is \u201cunfair\u201d to consumers if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition.24 A practice is \u201cdeceptive\u201d to consumers if it is likely to mislead a consumer, acting reasonably under the circumstances, with respect to a material matter. A matter is material if it is likely to have affected the consumer\u2019s conduct or decision with respect to a product or service.25 Proof of intent is not necessary to establish unfairness or deception.26 The elements of unfair and deceptive is further elaborated by the Department is its guidance document.27 Pursuant to its authority under section 41712, the Department proposes to require that airlines and ticket agents disclose bag fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag, family seating fees for a young child traveling with an adult, as well as change and cancellation fees and policies whenever fare and schedule information is provided to a consumer in response 24 14 CFR 399.79(b)(1). 25 14 CFR 399.79(b)(2). 26 14 CFR 399.79(c). 27 87 Fed. Reg. 52677 (August 28, 2022) 12 to a passenger-specific or anonymous itinerary search on a website marketed to U.S. consumers where air transportation is advertised or sold. This includes, but is not limited to, the first place a fare is stated in search results. The Department\u2019s tentative basis for concluding that the practices this NPRM would prohibit are unfair and deceptive is articulated in the paragraphs that follow. Bag Fees The Department tentatively considers not displaying bag fees, which have historically been included in the airfare (i.e., fee for first and second checked bag and carry-on bag) but are now often broken out from the airfare, in a passenger-specific manner whenever fare and schedule information is provided to be an unfair practice because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The substantial injury this practice is likely to cause is the additional time spent searching to find the total cost of travel and any additional funds spent on air transportation that might have been avoided if the consumer had been able to determine the true cost of travel up front and readily select the best price. This harm is not reasonably avoidable even with the disclosures mandated in the 2011 rulemaking that improved consumer access to first and second checked bag and carry-on bag fee information by requiring those fees to be displayed on airlines\u2019 and ticket agents\u2019 websites. Airlines and ticket agents continue to disclose bag fees in a static format in complex charts that are confusing to consumers and that are not readily available at the moment consumers need the information to comparison shop. Further, in connection with complex itineraries, interline tickets, and even some code-share flights, consumers are still reporting confusion regarding the total cost of baggage fees. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because consumer 13 confusion about applicable bag fees harms, rather than benefits, competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger-specific fees whenever fare and schedule information is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The practice of not displaying passenger-specific fees for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags when fare and schedule information is provided is also deceptive in that it misleads consumers into believing the total purchase price from one carrier or ticket agent is cheaper than that of another when that may not be the case. This belief is reasonable as carriers and agents often display only the air fare and not these bag fees during an itinerary search. As carriers have different policies regarding the fees and limitations imposed to transport baggage, and because variation within each carrier depends on the fare category purchased or the status of the passenger, the current requirement that carriers and ticket agents provide a generic notice that \u201cfees for baggage may apply\u201d during the booking process is not providing consumers sufficient notice of the total cost of the air transportation. In addition, although carriers and ticket agents are required to inform consumers during the booking process about where consumers can see baggage fees, consumers are often diverted to complex charts that are confusing, prolong the consumer\u2019s process of evaluating itineraries and fares for purchase, and may ultimately not be instructive for many consumers in determining the bag fee that would apply to them. The cost of the first and second checked bag and carry-on bag is often material to consumers, as knowing such costs in conjunction with the ticket price is likely to affect the consumer\u2019s purchase decisions. According to the GAO, since airlines first imposed checked baggage fees, the number 14 of checked bags per passenger has declined. GAO also explains that checked baggage fees have led to greater amounts of carry-on baggage.28 Change and Cancellation Fees and Policies The Department tentatively considers the practice of not clearly disclosing passenger- specific change and cancellation fees and policies during the ticket purchase process to be an unfair practice because it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The Department currently requires the disclosure of these fees on or with the ticket.29 However, this requirement means that consumers often receive information about these fees after the purchase of the ticket is already made (i.e., upon receipt of the ticket confirmation), which is not sufficient disclosure. The practice of not disclosing these fees early in the process and prior to ticket purchases causes substantial injury to consumers in that passengers may purchase tickets without adequate notice that they could incur significant fees to change or cancel their tickets, that they are not entitled to a refund in the original form of payment if they do cancel, or that there are other restrictions on their ability to change or cancel their tickets. These harms are not reasonably avoidable if the carrier or ticket agent does not provide disclosures on their cancellation or change policies during booking. Carriers may have separate webpages that contain such policy and fee information, but this information may be in a range, so consumers may not know the specific change or cancellation fee that would apply to them. Moreover, even if not in a range, change and cancellation policies and fees may not be simple to understand, as 28 GAO 10-785, Commercial Aviation: Consumers Could Benefit from Better Information about Airline-Imposed Fees and Refundability of Government-Imposed Taxes and Fees (July 14, 2010) at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao- 10-785.pdf . 29 See 14 CFR 253.7. 15 fare categories, passenger status, ticket type (e.g., award ticket purchases), and other factors may impact the applicable change and cancellation fees and policies. Further, because the cancellation and change fee information is not provided during the booking process, consumers would need to interrupt their booking process to search for the information and extend the time needed to complete a booking. The harm that consumers experience is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition because, like baggage fees, consumer surprise or confusion about applicable change and cancellation fees after airfare purchase harms, rather than benefits, competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of passenger-specific or non- passenger-specific change and cancellation fees whenever fare and schedule information is provided would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The Department also tentatively considers the practice of not displaying change and cancellation fees when fare and schedule information is provided to be deceptive. Without proper notice, consumers acting reasonably would be misled with respect to the change and cancellation policies that apply to their ticket and may believe that change or cancellations are possible at no fee or at a reduced fee. The Department has received complaints from consumers expressing surprise at the high level of the fees that have been imposed, in some cases, cancellation or change fees are higher than the fare paid by the consumer. Comments in a prior DOT rulemaking on ancillary fees also support the importance of disclosure of change and cancellation fees to consumers.30 The change and cancellation fees are therefore material because they could affect the consumer\u2019s decision on whether to purchase an airline ticket and if so, which airline to select. As such, the Department is of the tentative view that not displaying change and cancellation fees when fare and schedule information is provided is deceptive. 30 See comments submitted in the docket for the 2014 NPRM, which can be accessed at https://www.regulations.gov/search?filter=DOT-OST-2014-0056. 16 Family Seating Policies and Fees For similar reasons, the Department tentatively considers the lack of fee disclosure for adjacent seating when fare and schedule information is provided and restrictions on purchasing those seats at all point of sale to be an unfair practice for those traveling with a young child. This lack of disclosure and transactability of family seating information causes or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The practice causes substantial harm to consumers in that passengers may face situations in which they are unexpectedly separated from their children on flights or must pay unexpected fees to remain with their children. Also, despite information about carrier family seating policies being available on airlines\u2019 websites, the harm is not reasonably avoidable because a reasonable consumer would not believe that it is necessary to pay fees to be seated next to his or her young child and would not know to search for this information on an airline\u2019s website before purchasing the ticket. Even if the family seating fee is disclosed when fare and schedule information is provided that alone would not be sufficient. Transactability is necessary because consumers are not able to save the seat or lock in the price for adjacent seating at the time of ticket purchase. The number of family seating complaints that the Department receives against airlines is low31 but these consumers note being confused about the seating policies and fees that apply to 31 In calendar year 2017, .38% of complaints (44 complaints) filed with the Department by consumers against U.S. airlines concerned family seating. In calendar year 2018, .51% of air travel service complaints (46 complaints) against U.S. airlines concerned family seating. In calendar year 2019, 2.4% of air travel service complaints (230 family seating complaints) against U.S. airlines concerned family seating. This increase corresponded with the efforts of a consumer advocacy group to encourage air travelers to file complaints with the Department if they were dissatisfied with an experience related to family seating. Fewer than .5% of the air travel service complaints against U.S. airlines filed with the Department in calendar years 2020 and 2021 concerned family seating -- .46 % of 17 them and the harm that they face is significant. A substantial harm may be demonstrated by a large amount of harm to a small number of people.32 The likelihood of consumers being unexpectedly separated from their children on flight may increase when consumers purchase their tickets from a ticket agent without realizing that the fare category (e.g., basic economy) or the method of booking (e.g., the ticket agent arranged for separate bookings for each family member) selected did not adequately enable them to ensure adjacent seats. The need to consult a separate webpage during the booking process also presents the potential for increased confusion and a prolonging of the ticket purchase process. The Department looks at this element from the perspective of an ordinary consumer acting reasonably under the totality of the circumstances. Further, DOT concludes that the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition. The Department believes that the disclosure of the family seating fees when fare and schedule information is provided and the ability to purchase those seats at all points of sale would promote informed buyers, enhance competition, and lower prices. The Department also tentatively considers failing to disclose potential family seating fees when fare and schedule information is provided to be a deceptive practice.33 The lack of such fee information is likely to mislead consumers into believing that families will be able to be seated next to their children free of charge. It would also be a deceptive practice to disclose the family complaints (165 family seating complaints) in calendar year 2020 and .46% of complaints (94 family seating complaints) in calendar year 2021. 32 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) previously noted that \u2018\u2018it is well established that substantial injury may be demonstrated by a showing of a small amount of harm to a large number of people, as well as a large amount of harm to a small number of people.\u2019\u2019 See Opinion of the Commission, In the Matter of LabMD, Inc. (July 19, 2016) at 9 available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/160729labmd-opinion.pdf (\u201c LabMD\u201d). The Department\u2019s statutory authority to prohibit unfair practices was modeled on section 5 of the FTC Act. 33 \u201cSome cases involve omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the claim, practice, or sale from being misleading.\u201d See FTC 1983 Policy Statement on Deception, available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf . 18 seating fees but then not allow consumers to purchase those adjacent seats at all points of sale. The inability to purchase those seats immediately could mislead consumers as prices for seats are often dynamic and change based on availability and time of purchase. As evidenced by the consumer complaints the Department has received on this issue, the Department concludes that consumers have a reasonable belief that young children will be allocated a seat near a parent or guardian traveling with the child, and that the cost of ensuring adjacent seats with a child is material to consumers. 49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4) In carrying out aviation economic programs, including issuing this rulemaking under 49 U.S.C. 41712, the Department considers the factors identified in 49 U.S.C. 40101 as being in the public interest and consistent with public convenience and necessity. Under 49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4), the Department is required to consider the availability of a variety of adequate, economic, efficient, and low-priced services without unreasonable discrimination or unfair or deceptive practices as being in the public interest. The Department is also required by section 40101(a)(12) to consider as being in the public interest encouraging, developing, and maintaining an air transportation system relying on actual and potential competition to provide efficiency, innovation, and low prices. This rulemaking proposes to improve the transparency of airline pricing through the increased disclosure of bag fees, change and cancellation fees, and family seating policies during the ticket purchase process. As carriers vary on their policies for such fees and such information is often not provided during the purchase process, consumers of air transportation may have difficulty comparing the actual and potential costs of accessing the air transportation between different carriers. By improving this transparency, this rulemaking 19 would allow for better comparisons of airline ticket pricing, of which these fees are often a critical component, thereby encouraging price competition. D. Unfair or Deceptive Practice Request for a Hearing For the reasons discussed in the Statutory Authority section, the Department has tentatively concluded that the practice of not displaying applicable fees for first and second checked bags and carry-on bags during the ticket purchase process is both unfair and deceptive. For the reasons discussed in the Statutory Authority section, the Department has also tentatively concluded that the lack of disclosure regarding ticket change and cancellation fees and policies and family seating information during the ticket purchase process presents an unfair and deceptive practice. Pursuant to the Department\u2019s regulation at 14 CFR 399.75(b)(1), any interested party may file a petition to hold a hearing on the proposed rule prior to the close of the comment period. As stated in the DATES section, petitions must therefore be received by [INSERT DATE 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. The Department\u2019s regulations 14 CFR 399.75(b)(2) provide that the Department will grant a petition if the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing that granting the petition is in the public interest. Factors considered in determining whether a petition is in the public interest include \u201c(i) Whether the proposed rule depends on conclusions concerning one or more specific scientific, technical, economic, or other factual issues that are genuinely in dispute or that may not satisfy the requirements of the Information Quality Act; (ii) Whether the ordinary public comment process is unlikely to provide an adequate examination of the issues to permit a fully informed judgment; (iii) Whether the resolution of the disputed factual issues would likely have a material effect on the costs and benefits of the proposed rule; (iv) Whether the requested 20 hearing would advance the consideration of the proposed rule and the General Counsel\u2019s ability to make the rulemaking determinations required by this section; and (v) Whether the hearing would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking.\u201d DOT must also provide an explanation of the basis for the decision on a petition. (14 CFR 399.75(b)(3)). Summary of the Proposed Regulatory Provisions The Department is proposing to increase the protections provided to consumers as provided in the summary table below. Subject Proposal Covered entities The NPRM applies to: (1) U.S. air carriers; (2) foreign air carriers; (3) ticket agents that sell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agents, or online travel agencies; and (4) metasearch sites that do not sell airline tickets but display airline flight search options directly to consumers Airline Ancillary Service Fees Critical The ancillary services that the Department has to Consumer Decision identified as being critical to consumers when they choose among air transportation options are as follows: first and second checked bag, one carry-on bag, changing or canceling a reservation, and adjacent seating when traveling with a young child. Disclosure of Baggage Fees The Department is proposing to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag during the booking process when fare and schedule information is provided (typically first page of search results). Disclosure of Change and Cancellation The Department is proposing to require carriers and Fees and Policies ticket agents to disclose change and cancellation fees and policies to consumers during the booking process when fare and schedule information is provided (typically first page of search results). Disclosure of Family Seating Fees and The Department is proposing to require carriers and Policies ticket agents to disclose the seat fees applicable for passengers 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult in the same class of service during the booking process when fare and schedule 21 information is provided (typically first page of search results). Timing of Online Disclosures The Department proposes to require that first and second checked bag fee, the carry-on bag fee, the change and cancellation fee and the family seating fee be disclosed at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. Passenger-specific information The Department is proposing that the fee information disclosed to a consumer for critical ancillary services be expressed as passenger-specific information if a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search. \u2022 A passenger-specific itinerary search refers to a search that takes into account a characteristic of the passenger that may impact ancillary service fees to be charged (e.g., military status, frequent flyer status, method of payment, etc.) \u2022 An anonymous itinerary search refers to a search that does not take into account passenger characteristics that may have an impact on ancillary service fees to be charged. Web site and Mobile Displays The Department is proposing to require that the fees for ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision be disclosed to consumers using airlines\u2019 or ticket agent\u2019s websites and mobile web sites. In-Person or Telephone Disclosures of The Department is proposing to require that specific Airline Ancillary Service Fees fee information for a first and second check bag, one carry-on item, the canceling or changing of a reservation, and a passenger 13 or under to obtain a seat next to an accompanying adult be provided for each itinerary for which a fare is quoted to a consumer during an in-person or telephone inquiry. Sharing of Airline Ancillary Service Airlines would be required to distribute fee Fee Information with Ticket Agents information for critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display the airlines\u2019 fare and schedule information. The proposal specifies that the information provided to agents be usable, accurate and accessible in real- time. 22 Prohibition on Fee if Required Collecting a fee from consumers for critical ancillary Disclosure is Not Provided services without disclosure of this fee during the search process would be deemed an unfair and deceptive practice Transactability The Department is proposing that carriers and ticket agents enable family seating fees to be transactable at all points of sale. Compliance/Implementation Period Six-month implementation period to display a first and second checked bag fee, a carry-on bag fee, change and cancellation fee, and family seating fee (if any), to consumers whenever fare and schedule information is provided. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Covered entities In this NPRM, the Department proposes to require entities that advertise or sell air transportation to consumers in the United States to disclose, prior to ticket purchase, the fees for ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. This means that the proposed requirement would apply to U.S. air carriers; foreign air carriers; ticket agents that sell airline tickets, whether traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agents, or online travel agencies (OTA); and metasearch sites that display airline flight search options directly to consumers. However, Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) would not be covered by this proposal as GDSs arrange for air transportation but do not sell or display a carrier\u2019s fare to consumers. The Department solicits comment on whether the covered entities should be broader or more limited in scope. For example, regarding ticket agents who sell air transportation, should the proposed requirement to display information about certain critical ancillary services exclude 23 corporate travel agents because the display content is typically negotiated by the business involved? The airlines and ticket agents that are covered by this rulemaking do not need to be physically present in the United States. Given the expansion of e-commerce, in many cases, airlines and ticket agents can advertise and sell airline tickets to U.S. consumers without being physically located in the U.S. This NPRM would apply not only to airlines or ticket agents that are physically located in the U.S., but also to those that have a website marketed to consumers in the United States and display schedule, fare, and availability information for flights within, to, or from the United States. To determine whether a website is marketed to U.S. consumers, a variety of factors would be considered\u2014for example, whether the website is in English, whether the seller of air transportation displays prices in U.S. dollars or has an option on its website that differentiates sites or pages designed for the United States. The Department requests comment on other factors that may be indicative of the airline or ticket agent doing business in the United States. Because ticket agents cannot provide ancillary service fee information to consumers unless the information is first provided by carriers to ticket agents, the NPRM proposes to require air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide the fee information for critical ancillary services to all ticket agents that sell or display the carrier's fare and schedule information. While fare, schedule, and availability information are currently provided by the airlines to the GDSs, and by GDSs to the agents that display and sell to consumers, information about the cost of ancillary services is not typically shared. This NPRM would not require airlines to use GDSs to provide ancillary fee information to ticket agents that display or sell airline tickets to consumers although they would be free to do so if they wish. The Department\u2019s focus is on ensuring that 24 information about critical airline ancillary services reach consumers using the travel agent channel, regardless of process used, because a significant portion of airline tickets are purchased indirectly through ticket agents. The Department seeks comment on whether the Department should require that carriers provide fee information about critical ancillary services to GDSs. Why or why not? Airline Ancillary Service Fees Critical to Consumer Decision This rulemaking is intended to ensure that fee information about ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s decision making is disclosed at all points of sale prior to ticket purchase. The Department considers the cost of certain ancillary services to be important to consumers when they choose among air transportation options. Ancillary service means any service related to air travel provided by a carrier, for a fee, beyond passenger air transportation (i.e., the transport of the passenger on an aircraft from one location to another excluding optional services such as baggage, internet, and advance seat assignment). Ancillary service fees can include charges for things that have traditionally been included in the price of a ticket such as first and second checked bags or meals. It can also include services that airlines have typically charged separate from the airline ticket for many years, such as changing or canceling a reservation. The ancillary services that the Department has identified as being critical to consumers when they choose among air transportation options are as follows: first and second checked bag, one carry-on item, changing or canceling a reservation, and adjacent seating when traveling with a young child. The fees that consumer commenters to the Department\u2019s 2014 NPRM most commonly identified as being of critical importance were baggage, seat assignments and change or cancellation fees. These are also the top three most common ancillary service complaints 25 received by the Department. With regard to seat assignments, although there are fewer complaints about seat assignments for passengers traveling with small children, the complaints illustrate the critical importance parents and guardians place on ensuring that their children are seated next to them. We request comment on whether the Department's list of critical ancillary services should be expanded or reduced. Are there particular ancillary service fees (or set of fees) that have a material impact on the total price paid by the consumer or are of particular importance to consumers? What are the benefits and potential challenges to expanding or reducing the Department\u2019s list of critical ancillary services? Comments that are most useful provide information regarding the reasons why additional disclosures should or should not be required. The Department also seeks comment on how to address future adoption by airlines of additional ancillary service fees and how to ensure their disclosure to the extent that they are of critical importance to consumers. Types of Proposed Disclosures 1. First and second checked bag and carry-on bag The Department is proposing to require that carriers and ticket agents disclose fees for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag on the first page displayed when a consumer conducts a search for air transportation. This would replace the existing requirement to provide a generic notice during the booking process about baggage fees and a link to where the baggage fees can be found on the carrier\u2019s website. The fees would need to be adjusted to accurately reflect the itinerary of the passenger, the fare category selected, and the fees applicable to the passenger if the consumer has conducted a passenger-specific itinerary search. In instances where the carrier or ticket agent website displays multiple fare categories (e.g., basic economy, 26 restricted economy, flexible economy, and business class) for the same itinerary, the NPRM would require the carrier and ticket agent to also display the bag fees applicable to each fare category. Display of the baggage fee by links or rollovers is not permitted but we request comment on whether it should be permitted. The proposed rule would also clarify that airlines and ticket agents may choose to offer ancillary service packages or bundles that include bag fees, alongside the standalone bag fees that would be required to be displayed under this rulemaking.34 The proposal to disclose baggage fees does not apply to air-tour packages advertised or sold online by ticket agents if the air transportation component is not finalized and the carrier providing air transportation is not known at the time of booking. However, ticket agents in such situations would need to disclose that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger's frequent flyer status, method of payment or other consumer characteristic. When the identity of the carrier providing the air transportation becomes known, the ticket agent would need to provide the specific baggage fee information for the carrier to not only prospective customers, but also those who purchased the air-tour package before the identity of the carrier became known. We request comment on whether this exception for certain air-tour packages adequately addresses concerns of air-tour package sellers. We also request comment on whether such an exception adequately protects consumers. 2. Change and cancellation policies and fees 34 While the Department recognizes that here is the potential for confusion when both a standalone fee and a bundled fare are displayed if the airline or ticket agent does not do an adequate job of designing its website interface, but we would expect that these entities would be incentivized to clearly label what is included in any packaged bundles, and the separate bag fee information would allow consumers to know whether the package bundle is priced appropriately to suit their needs (or whether the consumer is better off purchasing the bag alone). 27 This rulemaking proposes making change and cancellation fees and policies more apparent to consumers when they book tickets. Under the proposal, carriers and ticket agents would have to display the fee to change a reservation and the fee to cancel a reservation on the first page that appears when a consumer conducts a search for air transportation and a fare is quoted. The fee information would need to be specific to each fare category displayed and adjusted based on passenger-specific information provided by the consumer. For example, if the fare category displayed requires a $50 fee to change the ticket, then the website should display the change fee for the itinerary and fare category as \u201c$50.\u201d If the consumer\u2019s status entitles the consumer to no change fees, then the website should display \u201c$0\u201d as the applicable change fee for the itinerary, provided that the consumer has entered passenger-specific information that meets the criteria for no change fees. Display of the cancellation and change fee by links or rollovers is not permitted but we request comment on whether it should be permitted. In addition to the change and cancellation fees, the Department is proposing to require that carriers and ticket agents provide information about certain aspects of their change and cancellation policies to consumers on the first page that appears when a consumer conducts a search. This information, which may be provided using links or pop-ups adjacent to the pertinent fee, would consist of: 1) a brief summary of the cancellation policy applicable to the consumer\u2019s chosen itinerary and fare category, taking into account the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific information provided, and 2) a brief summary of the ticket change policies applicable to the consumer\u2019s chosen itinerary and fare category, adjusted for the passenger-specific information provided. These brief summaries should provide consumers clear, adequate notice of the rules attached to the chosen itinerary and fare category, including whether ticket changes or cancellations are allowed (as well as when and in what circumstances they are allowed), the form 28 that refunds or airline credits may be provided (e.g. travel voucher or a credit to the original form of payment), any prohibitions or  that may limit the ability to change or cancel a ticket, and other information. The Department seeks comment on this proposal. Should the Department require change fees be disclosed as proposed? If so, how should the Department address the potential need for a consumer to also pay a fare difference between the old and new tickets brought about by dynamic pricing models35 many carriers employ? Does the material change in fare that occurs with many ticket changes being a potentially larger component of the overall price relative to the change fee itself represent a more confusing situation for consumers? Should the Department only require change fees be disclosed, or should it also require cancellation fees to be disclosed as proposed? Should the Department allow the proposed disclosures to be provided later in the ticket purchase process than proposed in this NPRM? Are there preferred methods for presenting the change and cancellation policy information? This rulemaking also proposes to require that carriers and ticket agents with websites marketed to U.S. consumers where they sell air transportation display on the last page of the booking process (before the consumer clicks a button that executes the purchase or reservation) a brief statement on whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer\u2019s booking to be cancelled without penalty within 24 hours, or whether the carrier or ticket agent permits the consumer to hold the reservation without payment for 24 hours. Under 14 CFR 259.5(b)(4), carriers must currently either permit consumers to cancel their tickets within 24 hours of purchase without penalty, or, alternatively, allow consumers to hold their reservations at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, provided that the purchase or reservation is made at least one week before the flight\u2019s departure. The policy that the carrier chooses must be disclosed 35 A dynamic pricing model implements price differentiation for the airline seat and generally increases the price of the service as fewer seats are available and decreases the price of the service when more seats are available. 29 in its customer service plan pursuant to 14 CFR 259.5. The Department is now proposing that the carrier\u2019s chosen policy also be disclosed on the last page of the booking process. Although ticket agents are not required to develop customer service plans under 14 CFR 259.5, this rulemaking would also require ticket agents to disclose the ticket agent\u2019s policy for allowing consumers to cancel their reservations without penalty soon after purchase or for allowing consumers to hold their reservation without purchase for a specified period. If carriers or ticket agents offer both alternatives, which they are not required to do so, then this information should be disclosed to consumers. The Department seeks comment on this additional disclosure. 3. Seat assignment policies and fees for families traveling with young children The Department is of the tentative view that disclosure of an advance seat assignment fee at the beginning of a booking process is generally not needed because airlines are required to provide a seat with the cost of the air transportation. However, advance seat assignments are of critical importance to families traveling with young children. While these families may not need a guarantee of a particular seat in advance, they are looking for a guarantee that at least one accompanying adult would be seated next to a young child. Section 2309 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 required the Department to review U.S. airline family seating policies and, \u201cif appropriate, establish a policy directing all air carriers providing scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation to establish policies that enable a child, who is age 13 or under on the date an applicable flight is scheduled to occur, to be seated in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member over the age of 13, to the maximum extent practicable and at no additional cost, except when assignment to an adjacent seat would require an upgrade to another cabin class or a seat with extra legroom or seat pitch for which additional payment is normally required.\u201d In response to 30 section 2309, the Department\u2019s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection issued a notice urging airlines to do everything that they can to ensure the ability of a parent to sit next to his or her young child, including allowing every young child to sit next to a parent, without charging fees for adjacent seating.36 To the extent airlines do charge fees for a young child to sit next to a parent, the Department is proposing to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose these fees to consumers alongside the quoted fare for each itinerary. More specifically, the NPRM proposes that carriers and ticket agents disclose alongside the fare the seat fee, if any, that could be imposed for aa child age 13 or under to be seated adjacent (i.e., directly next to, and uninhibited by an aisle or other obstruction) to an accompanying adult in the same class of service, so that consumers are informed on the potential ticket costs. If the carrier does not impose a fee for children 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult, no seat fee disclosure would be required for the carrier\u2019s flights. If the carrier does impose fees for children to be assigned seats next to an accompanying adult, then the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s website should disclose the fee to select a seat that is part of a pair of available adjacent seats. Display of the fee by links or rollovers is not permitted but we request comment on whether it should be permitted. The proposal to disclose the fee for adjacent seating for those traveling with a young child whenever fare and schedule information is provided is intended to be performance-based. The Department is not prescribing a particular way for the regulated entities to comply but notes that there are several acceptable means of compliance. For example, to ensure that a consumer receives family seating information as part of the itinerary search results and accompanying fare quotations, a carrier or ticket agent could decide to enable consumers to disclose that a passenger 36 See https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/family-seating/June-2022-notice 31 13 or under will be traveling prior to initiating an itinerary search. A carrier or ticket agent could alternatively decide to display family seating fees for all itinerary searches, regardless of whether a consumer disclosed that a passenger was 13 or under. As another alternative, carriers that do not impose a fee for children 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult would not be obligated to provide any family seating disclosures during the itinerary search and selection process. As the Department is aware that seat fees can fluctuate frequently, the Department is proposing that family seating fees that are quoted during the itinerary selection process be transactable at the point of ticket purchase, including on ticket agent websites. (See section on \u201cSharing of Airline Ancillary Service Fee Information with Ticket Agents\u201d, below.) The Department seeks comment on its proposed disclosures to assist families traveling with young children. Should the Department permit these disclosures to be provided later during the booking process, such as after the stage when a consumer inputs passenger name and age information? Should the Department be more prescriptive about family seat fee disclosure requirements (e.g., requiring that websites be modified to enable consumers to indicate whether a passenger will be 13 or under prior to initiating the search)? Are there technical or other practical considerations for requiring that family seating fees be disclosed and transactable? Should disclosure be limited to fees or would additional information regarding airline family seating policies be useful to consumers during the ticket purchase process? What disclosure should be required, if any, when no adjacent seats are available at the time of the consumer\u2019s ticket purchase? The Department welcomes responses to these questions. Online Disclosures of Airline Ancillary Service Fees 1. Timing of Online Disclosures 32 During the 2022 ACPAC meeting, DOT solicited information on the appropriate timing of disclosure for ancillary service fees (e.g., at the time of an initial display of schedule information, or at other times during the booking process, or at the end of the process before a final purchase). The ACPAC member representing consumers observed that in order to minimize problems with drip pricing, consumers should have information on critical ancillary service fees early in the process; however, he also noted that providing early information on all ancillary fees could lead to consumers being overwhelmed.37 Specifically, he opined that baggage fees, change/cancellation fees, and seat reservation fees were the biggest \u201cpain points\u201d for consumers that should be disclosed early. Similarly, a consumer advocacy organization suggested that fees for carry-on and checked bags, as well as change/cancellation fees and on-time/cancellation statistics, should be displayed on the first page where a price is quoted.38 This rulemaking proposes that if a U.S. or foreign air carrier or ticket agent has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation, the carrier and ticket agent would disclose the first and second checked bag fee, the carry-on bag fee, the change and cancellation fee, and the seat fee for a child 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult, at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. It is important that a consumer be provided fee information for critical ancillary services at the same time as the fare information is being provided to enable the consumer to make an informed purchasing decision. We believe that requiring disclosure during the search process benefits consumers because information disclosed at the last minute may result in some 37 Comment of John Breyault (Day 1 AM session). 38 Presentation of FlyersRights, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2018-0190-0046. 33 consumers deciding to revisit all the travel arrangements already made and possibly begin the reservation process again to look for flights again. Regarding disclosure of the fee for a child 13 or under to be seated adjacent to an accompanying adult, the Department is proposing to require carriers and ticket agents enable consumers to purchase the seat fee that is disclosed during the itinerary search at the same time as the ticket purchase. Prices for advance seat assignments are often dynamic and change based on availability and time of purchase. While carriers are prohibited from increasing the change and cancellation fee, the first and second checked bag fee, and the carry-on bag fee after the ticket has been purchased,39 this is not the case for a seat assignment fee. Carriers are allowed to increase the price of an advance seat assignment until the seat assignment itself is purchased. The Department seeks comment on the timing of the proposed online fee disclosures in this rulemaking. 2. Passenger-specific information The Department is proposing that the fee information disclosed to a consumer for critical ancillary services be expressed as passenger-specific charges if the consumer elects to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent, such as frequent flyer type, payment method, or military status. For example, a passenger who is active in the military may be entitled to an additional piece of checked luggage free of charge, or a passenger who has qualified at the 39 See 14 CFR 253.7, which prohibits carriers from imposing monetary penalties on passengers unless the passenger receives conspicuous written notice on or with the ticket. See also Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket (December 28, 2011). In that guidance, the Department announced that with respect to fees for ancillary services that were not purchased with the air transportation, it would only enforce the prohibition on post-purchase price increases for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags. The application of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was also at issue in a lawsuit filed by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the December 28, 2011, guidance and upheld the Department's rule prohibiting post-purchase price increases as it is currently being applied. Spirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20-21. Petition for Writ of Certiorari denied on April 1, 2013. 34 highest tier of a carrier\u2019s frequent flyer program may be entitled to a maximum checked luggage weight limit of 70 pounds per piece. The carrier or ticket agent would know that a consumer is conducting a passenger-specific itinerary search if the consumer has entered this passenger- specific information either prior to initiating the itinerary search, or if the consumer has logged into his or her account on the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s website, provided that the consumer\u2019s user profile contains the passenger-specific information. If the consumer conducting a search elects not to provide passenger-specific information to the carrier or ticket agent (i.e., the consumer conducts an \u201canonymous itinerary search\u201d), then the Department is proposing to require carriers and ticket agents to disclose the fees for these ancillary services as itinerary-specific charges. Itinerary-specific refers to variations in fees that depend on, for example, geography, travel dates, cabin (e.g., first class, economy), and ticketed fare class (e.g., full fare ticket\u2014Y class). It is essentially an anonymous search. The Department seeks comment on the benefits, risks, and practicability of the proposed distinction between anonymous itinerary searches and passenger-specific searches, as described above. 3. Opt-Out Option This NPRM does not propose to permit airlines and ticket agents to enable consumers to opt out of receiving fee information for critical ancillary services during the search process. The Department seeks comment on whether it should allow carriers and ticket agents to provide consumers an opt-out option from receiving ancillary service fee information that would otherwise be required. Opt-out options could potentially include the choice to opt out of seeing all baggage fee information that would otherwise be required to be displayed (first and second checked bag and carry-on bag), to opt out of seeing fee information related to changing or canceling a reservation, to opt out of seeing seat fee information for a child traveling with an 35 adult, or to opt out of seeing some of those fees. We anticipate that fee information for critical ancillary services will improve the decisions made by consumers but seek comment on whether the volume of information proposed to be displayed would assist or overwhelm consumers and whether or not an opt-out provision would be beneficial to consumers. Is an opt-out provision needed to ensure that consumers can avoid receiving ancillary service fee information that is of no interest to them? We are also interested in learning what impact, if any, lack of an opt-out provision has on the speed of search results or particular display options an airline or ticket agent may provide. For commenters advocating an opt-out option, we also request information about how to define requirements for opt-out options that would adequately protect consumers and ensure any opt-out option is not confusing or abused, for example, preventing opt-outs accomplished through a \u201cclick wrap\u201d or \u201cbrowser wrap\u201d tactic that does not represent a meaningful, intentional choice. The Department may consider adopting an opt-out provision in the final rule upon review of comments received and on further consideration by the Department. 4. Website and Mobile Displays The Department is proposing to require that the fees for ancillary services that are critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision be disclosed to consumers using airlines\u2019 or ticket agent\u2019s websites and mobile websites. Consumers in increasing numbers are using mobile devices to book travel. The Department believes that it is important that the same disclosures that would be provided on airlines\u2019 and ticket agents\u2019 desktop websites be provided on mobile websites. The Department seeks comment on whether it should also consider specific fee disclosure requirements for airlines\u2019 or ticket agents\u2019 mobile applications (apps). The Department seeks comment on whether the proposed disclosure requirements should also extend to airline and ticket agent mobile apps, and whether there are any practical distinctions between information 36 accessed on mobile websites and mobile apps. It would be helpful to the Department for commenters to provide data on the percentage of tickets booked on mobile applications, mobile websites, and desktop websites, or other usage statistics that are relevant. The Department is proposing to allow carriers and ticket agents limited flexibility in how information on ancillary services is displayed on desktop and mobile websites. Although this proposal would require carriers and ticket agents to display information for certain baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and family seating fees at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary, it permits the use of links or rollovers for other pieces of information. The Department seeks comment on whether links and rollovers would provide the necessary flexibility to allow for design displays that would enhance the user experience and encourage innovation as technology changes. Are additional flexibilities needed to ensure the display of ancillary service fee information does not result in screen clutter? Do rollovers work on mobile devices that have no cursor to hover over a link? Considering the screen size of mobile devices, would the proposed display requirement work on mobile platforms? Will there be a danger of too much unnecessary information creating confusion if fees that are not under consideration are displayed and are there ways the \u201ctoo much information\u201d can be mitigated? The Department also requests that commenters provide information as to whether hyperlink or other disclosures not adjacent to the fare on mobile sites would or would not be effective. Should the disclosure requirements be limited to websites accessed through desktop applications and not apply to those accessed through mobile applications? In-Person or Telephone Disclosures of Airline Ancillary Service Fees In addition to the online disclosures proposed by this rulemaking, the Department is proposing similar disclosures for tickets purchased using offline means (i.e., tickets purchased by 37 telephone or at the ticket counter). Under the proposal, ticket agents and carriers would have to disclose to consumers purchasing tickets in-person or on the phone the specific baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and family seating fees that apply to an itinerary for which a fare is quoted to the consumer, adjusted based on the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. During a given encounter (phone call, visit), the Department is proposing that a ticket agent or carrier not wait until after the consumer has decided to make the reservation or purchase the ticket to disclose the baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees or family seating fees that may apply. Instead, the disclosure would be required to be made at the time that the schedule information is being provided to the consumer during the \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cdecision-making\u201d portion of the conversation. In essence, a carrier or ticket agent would not be in compliance if it were to provide a quote for a ticket price over the phone or in-person without also providing the baggage, change, cancellation, and family seating fees that apply. The Department seeks comment on its proposals that carriers and ticket agents inform consumers of the bag fees, change and cancellation fees, and family seating fees that apply when consumers attempt to purchase airline tickets offline, in person, or on the phone. The Department is also interested in obtaining input on alternative options for providing such fee information on the phone or in person (e.g., explaining that fees may apply and referring the consumer to the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s website, provided that the website is accessible to consumers with disabilities)). 38 Sharing of Airline Ancillary Service Fee Information with Ticket Agents 1. Ticket Agents that Sell or Display Airline Fare and Schedule Information Under this proposal, airlines would be required to distribute fee information for critical ancillary services to ticket agents that sell or display the airlines\u2019 fare and schedule information. Carriers would not be required to distribute ancillary service fee information to any ticket agent to whom the carrier does not choose to distribute its fare, schedule, and availability information. In other words, if a carrier does not share fare information with a ticket agent, then this proposal would not require that carrier to share ancillary service fee information with that ticket agent. Also, under this proposal, the method and channels that carriers use to distribute fee information to ticket agents would be left to the discretion of the carrier.40 The Department is not proposing to require carriers to distribute ancillary service fee information to GDSs because GDSs arrange for air transportation and do not sell or display a carrier's tickets directly to consumers. By not requiring that ancillary service fee information be provided to GDSs, the Department is attempting to minimize government interference with business relationships. However, carriers are free to distribute this information to GDSs if they choose to do so. GDSs may provide the lowest cost and most efficient way of distributing this information to ticket agents that sell or display the carrier\u2019s ancillary services. Most ticket agents currently receive airline fare information through GDSs and rely on GDSs as an efficient source of data. Using GDSs may facilitate display of critical airline ancillary services. Airlines and ticket agents would 40 Industry stakeholders have expressed their views on information distribution in meetings with the Department. In a meeting with OACP on December 15, 2021, American Airlines offered its view that, while it supports expanded disclosure of ancillary service fees, it cautioned the Department against requiring that the distribution of such information be made through specific channels, such as global distribution systems. In a meeting with OACP on February 23, 2022, the Travel Technology Association (TravelTech) noted that ancillary fee information can only be provided by ticket agents to the extent they receive it from carriers. Travel Tech indicated that its members may engage in bilateral agreements with airlines to present certain ancillary rule information to consumers and in some cases may enable consumers to buy a pre-paid seat through their websites. 39 have to work in good faith to come to agreement on the method used to transmit the ancillary service fee information. The Department solicits comment on its preliminary decision not to require airlines to share ancillary service fee data with GDSs. Should the Department require carriers to distribute the ancillary service fee information to all ticket agents, including GDSs, to which the carrier provides fare, schedule, and availability information? How would OTAs and metasearch sites receive ancillary service fee information from multiple airlines and disclose that information to consumers if airlines do not provide that information to GDSs? The Department is striving to find the most beneficial disclosure rule for consumers while avoiding any adverse impact on innovations in the air transportation marketplace, contract negotiations between carriers and their distribution partners, and a carrier's ability to set its own fees and fares in response to its own commercial strategy and market forces. 2. Usable, accurate and current (dynamic) ancillary service fee information The Department is proposing that U.S. and foreign air carriers provide ticket agents ancillary service fee information that is usable, accurate, and accessible in real-time. It would not be sufficient for carriers to provide static pricing to ticket agents. Under this NPRM, carriers would be expected to facilitate the ability of ticket agents to access certain baggage fee, change fee, and cancellation fee information in a non-static, dynamic fashion. The Department does not prescribe the method that carriers would use to distribute the information as it wants to minimize government interference and encourage innovation. A carrier may choose to distribute ancillary fee information through GDSs if it provides the lowest and most efficient way to comply, given that many airlines and ticket agents use GDSs today. In the United States, three GDSs (Sabre, Travelport and Amadeus) distribute the airline product for the ticket agent channel, and most 40 airlines use the GDSs to distribute their products to ticket agents, including corporate travel agents that sell the higher revenue tickets. In the alternative, airlines may choose to distribute the ancillary fee information through direct connections between airline reservations systems and ticket agent systems. Another option may be to distribute ancillary fee information using the International Air Transport Association\u2019s (IATA) New Distribution Capability (NDC), which is essentially an XML-based technical standard for use in airline distribution. The Department would expect airlines to work in good faith with ticket agents to come to agreement on the method used to transmit the ancillary service fee information. Under this proposal, carriers would not be required to provide information to ticket agents about individual customers but rather the itinerary-specific and passenger-specific information that would impact the fee for a critical ancillary service. The Department expects that carriers and ticket agents would modify how searches for flights are done to allow consumers to identify any passenger-specific factors that may impact the fees that consumers might pay for critical ancillary services. This would enable consumers to better understand the total cost of the air transportation to them. Prohibition on Fee if Required Disclosure is Not Provided Under this proposal, the practice of collecting a fee from consumers for critical ancillary services without disclosure of this fee during the search process would be deemed an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712. Any fee that has been unlawfully imposed and collected would need to be refunded to consumers by the seller of the air transportation. Transactability The 2017 SNPRM did not propose that ancillary service fees be transactable. At the 2022 ACPAC meeting, representatives of the travel technology industry recommended that the 41 Department require ancillary fee information to be provided to ticket agents in a transactable format so that consumers would not have to engage in a separate transaction to complete the full purchase of air travel.41 Airlines stressed that they value transparency of fare and ancillary fee information across all channels, and argued that fee information is often made available to GDSs and third-party sellers, but that information may not be adequately transmitted to consumers.42 The Department is not proposing to require that certain ancillary services (i.e., first and second checked bag, one carry-on item, and changing or canceling a reservation) be transactable at all points of sale. Requiring transactability at all points of sale would mean requiring airlines to permit online travel agencies to sell these ancillary services. The Department is of the tentative view that this is unnecessary, given the regulatory limitations placed on increasing these fees following a ticket purchase, as discussed above. The Department has not identified evidence of consumer harm resulting from a lack of transactability of baggage, change, or cancellation fees. A consumer would pay a change or cancellation fee only if the consumer makes a change or cancels a reservation. There is nothing to transact at the time of ticket purchase. Also, the change and cancellation fee that a consumer would pay cannot increase after ticket purchase. As for baggage, a consumer is not harmed from not being able to pay a fee to transport a first checked bag, a second checked bag or a carry-on item at the time of ticket purchase because sellers of air transportation cannot increase the fees for these items beyond what existed at the time that the consumer purchased the airline ticket. The Department's existing rule regarding baggage fee price increases and related enforcement 41 See presentations of ASTA, Travel Tech, and Amadeus, and Skyscanner, available at https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/ACPAC/June2022Meeting/webcast (Day 1 afternoon session). 42 See, e.g., presentations of IATA, American and Delta, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT- OST-2018-0190. 42 policy ensures that the price to transport a first checked bag, a second checked bag, or a carry-on item does not increase following the ticket purchase and before the consumer has the opportunity to purchase baggage transportation services. Regarding seat assignment fees for a child 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult, the Department is proposing a requirement that ticket agents disclose fees for specific seat assignments. Such a proposal, without transactability, would cause consumers to be presented with seat assignment options that they cannot purchase immediately during the booking process, but which could change by the time a consumer attempts to purchase the seat. There is a risk that consumers would be confused by being presented a seat assignment that they cannot obtain at the advertised price. As such, the Department is proposing to require that carriers and ticket agents make seat fees for a child 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult to be transactable at the time the ticket purchase is made. DOT has encouraged airlines not to impose such a charge, but to the extent they do impose such charges, the proposed rule would require disclosure and transactability. This rulemaking may further incentivize airlines not to charge fees for a young child to sit next to an accompanying adult. The Department welcomes comment on whether airlines\u2019 response to this rulemaking would include reducing or eliminating such charges. Also, the Department solicits comment on requiring airlines to disclose that they charge fees for adjacent seating without disclosing the amount and requiring that it be transactable as proposed. Impact on Existing Requirements This proposed rule, if adopted, would require carriers and ticket agents to provide passenger-specific baggage fee information (if passenger-specific information is provided by the 43 consumer) for one carry-on item and a first and second checked bag at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary. 14 CFR 399.85(b) requires carriers and ticket agents to state that baggage fees may apply on the first screen where a fare quotation is available and refer consumers to a page on their websites where this information may be obtained. We are tentatively of the view that there would no longer be a need for such a requirement except for certain ticket agent displays related to air tour packages that are unable to provide customer-specific baggage fee information. In addition to amending 14 CFR 399.85(b), we are considering eliminating the requirement in 14 CFR 399.85(c) regarding disclosure of bag fee information on e-ticket confirmations as it may be of limited use. Current requirements in 14 CFR 399.85(c) provide that carriers and ticket agents must include specific fee information for first and second checked bags and a carry-on item on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation, and the fee information must take into account factors such as frequent flyer status that affect those charges. Under the proposed rule, consumers would have already received this information during the search process. We request comment on whether there is any benefit in retaining the requirements in 14 CFR 399.85(c) if the proposed requirement to display passenger-specific baggage fee information is adopted. Also, under the existing regulation in 14 CFR 399.85(a), carriers must promptly and prominently disclose any increase in bag fees and changes in bag allowances on the homepages of their websites for at least three months after the change becomes effective. This NPRM does not propose substantive changes to this requirement and proposes only language changes to clarify the scope of websites the regulation is intended to impact. These proposed changes to 14 CFR 399.85(a) are intended to make the regulation more consistent with other regulations related 44 to carrier and ticket agent websites. We request comment on whether the notice provision in 14 CFR 399.85(a) of the existing regulation would still be useful to consumers if this NPRM is adopted as final. The Department is also proposing to amend 14 CFR 399.88, which states that any seller of scheduled air transportation within, to, or from the United States is prohibited from increasing the price after the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee if the potential for an increase was disclosed as required prior to purchase. Under 14 CFR 399.88, the prohibition on increasing the price includes increases in fees for ancillary services such as those for checked baggage, carry-on baggage, advance or upgraded seating assignments, pillows and blankets, and meals, regardless of whether these items are purchased along with the air transportation. However, in December 2011, the Department announced that with respect to fees for ancillary services that were not purchased with the air transportation, it would only enforce the prohibition on post-purchase price increases for carry-on bags and first and second checked bags.43 The application of the prohibition of the post-purchase price increase was also at issue in a lawsuit filed by two airlines against the Department. The court considered the rule as applied under the December 28, 2011, guidance and upheld the Department's rule prohibiting post-purchase price increases as it is currently being applied.44 The Department is proposing to amend section 399.88 to be consistent with how it is currently being applied. This rulemaking does not propose changes to the existing prohibition in 43 See also Guidance on Price Increases of Ancillary Services and Products not Purchased with the Ticket (December 28, 2011). 44 Spirit Airlines, Inc., v. U.S. Dept. of Transportation (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2012), slip op. at 20-21. Petition for Writ of Certiorari denied on April 1, 2013. 45 section 399.88 against increasing the price of air transportation after its purchase, nor does it propose additional ancillary services beyond baggage that has traditionally been included in the price of a ticket to be frozen at the time of ticket purchase. In other words, the proposed amendment to section 399.88 would continue to require sellers of scheduled air transportation to apply the bag fee policies and fees that existed at the time the ticket is purchased for the first and second checked bag and carry-on item. For example, if the standard first checked bag fee at the time of ticket purchase is $30 when purchased in advance, $50 when purchased at the airport, and free for an elite frequent flyer, then the passenger would not pay a bag fee if he or she maintains the elite frequent flyer status on the date of travel. However, if the passenger does not maintain the same status and pays for the bag at the airport, the passenger would pay $50 for the first checked bag. The Department seeks comment on its amendment of section 399.88. Should the Department require that the price for ancillary services not purchased with the ticket be frozen beyond first and second checked bag and a carry-on item? For example, should it extend to fees for all baggage (including fees for oversized or overweight bags) or all ancillary services that have been identified as being critical to a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision? Further, the Department is proposing non-substantive changes to the current requirement in 14 CFR 399.84(a) that when a carrier or ticket agent quotes a price in advertising or a solicitation, the price should be the total fare, inclusive of taxes and fees. The proposed changes consist of minor changes to section 399.84(a) to promote readability, as well as additional language to accommodate the ancillary fee disclosures proposed in this NPRM. More specifically, we are proposing that if a consumer wishes to view ancillary service fees such as bag fees incorporated into the total quoted price during an itinerary search, carriers and ticket agents would be permitted to display the total price of the transportation, inclusive of mandatory 46 taxes and fees and the consumer\u2019s selected ancillary service fees, more prominently than a price that includes only all mandatory charges. The Department is seeking comment on this clarification to 14 CFR 399.84(a). Again, these language adjustments are not intended to make substantive changes to the full fare rule. As stated in 14 CFR 399.84(a), carriers and ticket agents may state separately charges included within the single total price on their websites, but such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed more prominently than the total price, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge. Consistent with this requirement, advertisements that state discounts in the form of percentage-off sales must refer to a discount off the total price to be paid by the consumer for the ticket, unless the airline or ticket agent explicitly states that the discount is based on only a portion of the fare. For example, an advertisement that indicates air transportation is on sale for a percentage off but does not apply the discount to the total price would be misleading if it did not specify that it is a percentage off only the \u201cbase\u201d fare or other fare component. When the  \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare\u201d are used in an advertisement stating a percentage off, a reasonable consumer would understand that the percentage off applies to the total price of the transportation. The Department is of the view that it would be an unfair and deceptive practice for an airline or ticket agent to advertise discounts off a \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d or \u201cfare,\u201d without disclosing in the first instance that the discount is only applied to a component of the total price (e.g., the \u201cbase\u201d fare). The practice is unfair in that consumers are likely to encounter higher charges than expected, which can multiply if a consumer relies on the promotional discount for multiple passengers on an itinerary. The harm is not easily avoided due to a lack of clarity in the advertising language that carriers 47 use. The Department has also not identified any benefits to consumers or to competition from this practice. The practice is also deceptive in that the carriers\u2019 advertising is likely to mislead consumers into believing that the discount will be applied to the entire ticket price (i.e., the full fare), rather than only a portion of the price to be paid. The belief that a discount applies to the total price when the advertisement provides a discount off of the \u201cflight,\u201d \u201cticket,\u201d \u201cfare,\u201d or other  of this nature, is reasonable. The total required charge that a consumer will be made to pay for air transportation is also material. The Department is also concerned that there is lack of clarity about the meaning of the term \u201cbase\u201d fare. In some cases, even offering a discount off the \u201cbase fare\u201d may be misleading if, without more clarity, the discount only applies to a portion of the carrier-imposed charges, and not the total amount of carrier-imposed charges (i.e., the fare for the transportation plus carrier-imposed charges such as fuel surcharges and other mandatory carrier fees). The Department solicits comment on defining base fare to mean all of the carrier- imposed charges included within the total price. The Department is soliciting comment on whether the full fare regulation should be amended to provide greater clarity on this type of advertising. Compliance Period The Department is tentatively of the view that a six-month implementation period from the issuance date of a final rule would be appropriate for carriers and ticket agents to display a first and second checked bag fee, a carry-on bag fee, change and cancellation fee, and family seating fees to consumers whenever fare and schedule information is provided online. It also provides sufficient time to train agents to provide fee information for critical ancillary services to consumers when providing fare and schedule information in person or over the phone. It also 48 takes into account the time needed for carriers to share ancillary service fee information with ticket agents In proposing this implementation period, the Department also considered the time that would be needed for airlines and ticket agents to organize ancillary fee data and reprogram and test their web sites. Separately, the Department considers the time needed to determine how ancillary service fee information will be distributed from carriers to ticket agents. At the June 2022 ACPAC meeting, one airline representative indicated that broadly speaking, sharing ancillary fee data with ticket agents is not technologically difficult and could be accomplished within a short time frame.45 If this proposal were to become a final rule, we would anticipate carriers will work in good faith with ticket agents to ensure that the distribution method and details are worked out well in advance of the display deadline. We request comment on whether the Department should impose a date certain by which carriers must share ancillary service fee information with ticket agents. We also seek comment on whether proposed implementation periods are too lengthy or too short. If the proposed implementation periods are either too lengthy or too short, how long of an implementation period would be appropriate and why? REGULATORY NOTICES Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The Office of Management and Budget has determined that this proposed rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and requires an assessment of 45 Remark of American Airlines, available at June 28 and 29, 2022 Meeting of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) | US Department of Transportation (Day 1 afternoon session) 49 potential benefits and costs. Accordingly, the Department has prepared a regulatory impact analysis for the proposed rule, summarized in this section and available in the docket. The proposed rule changes how U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose information about certain ancillary fees for flights and changes how certain customers can purchase assigned seats. Ancillary fees are fees for optional services provided by a carrier beyond passenger air transportation. The proposed rule would require carriers and ticket agents to show baggage fees, ticket change fees, and ticket cancellation fees when they first show fares and schedules to consumers searching for flights. The proposed rule would also require the seating fees for children 13 or under to be shown by airlines and ticket agents that display or sell tickets whenever fare and schedule information is provided. In addition, the Department is proposing that consumers be able to transact (i.e., purchase) these fees from airlines and ticket agents that sell tickets. Finally, the proposed rule would require carriers and ticket agents to provide the same ancillary fee information to consumers buying tickets in person or on the phone. The regulatory impact analysis uses a basic economic model of asymmetric information as a framework for evaluating the proposed rule. Due to a lack of data and other significant uncertainties, it is not possible to evaluate the effects of the proposed rule quantitatively. The rulemaking would yield societal benefits if it leads to reduced deadweight loss from inaccurate price calculations or reduced search costs. Inaccurate price calculations lead to overconsumption and can distort consumer perceptions in ways that confer a competitive advantage to producers who produce a lower-quality product. While we lack information to estimate benefits, we calculated a hypothetical example range using methods from earlier rulemakings. At the same time, the rulemaking could conceivably lead to crowding out of 50 relevant information for some consumers. The potential effect represents an offset to benefits, and it is possible that it equals or outweighs the benefits. Thus, it is not possible to quantify at this time whether the proposed rule yields benefits that exceed costs. The primary costs of the proposed rule are the costs that carriers and ticket agents would incur to share ancillary fee data, modify websites, and allow transactability for assigned seats for children 13 or under. These costs include startup implementation costs as well as ongoing costs. Third parties involved in data exchange, such as global distribution systems (GDSs)) and direct- channel companies, would incur costs as well despite not being directly regulated by the rule. Because these entities are already starting to upgrade systems for market reasons, the cost properly associated with the proposed rule is the cost of requiring them to upgrade earlier than they would without the rule. Table 1 summarizes the results of the analysis and the potential economic effects of the proposed rule. Table 1: Summary of annual economic effects Item Annual amount Benefits Gross benefits Reduction in deadweight loss due to increased accuracy in consumers\u2019 See illustrative price calculations example in RIA Reduction in search costs for consumers seeking information on See illustrative ancillary fees example in RIA Reduction in surprise costs and anxiety for passengers traveling with Not estimated children Market feedback effects (enhanced price and quality combinations) Not estimated Offsets to gross benefits Increase in search costs for consumers seeking information on items Not estimated displaced by new disclosures Total benefits Indeterminate 51 Costs Implementation and contract negotiation costs for carriers, ticket agents, See illustrative GDS companies, and direct-connect companies to display ancillary fees example in RIA and allow transactability for assigned seats for children 13 or under Ongoing costs for carriers to provide data See illustrative example in RIA Ongoing costs for carriers and ticket agents to exchange and maintain Not estimated ancillary fee information for offline and in-person purchases Total costs Not estimated Transfers Gains in consumer surplus (from airlines back to consumers) Indeterminate Net benefits Indeterminate Table 2 summarizes the key uncertainties for quantifying or monetizing the economic effects of the proposed rule. The same uncertainties that prevent the estimation of primary impacts preclude the assessment of potential secondary effects, including effects on airfares, ancillary fees, ancillary services, or GDS contracts with carriers and ticket agents. The Department seeks comment on these issues, as well as on potential implementation costs of the proposed rule and the potential changes on consumer search costs and decision-making.

This notice does not propose any requirement that (1) has substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the national government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, (2) imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, or (3) preempts State law. States are already preempted from regulating in this area by the Airline Deregulation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713. Therefore, the consultation and funding requirements of Executive Order 13132 do not apply. 53 Executive Order 13175 This notice has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13175 (\u201cConsultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments\u201d). Because none of the options on which we are seeking comment would significantly or uniquely affect the communities of the Indian tribal governments or impose substantial direct compliance costs on them, the funding and consultation requirements of Executive Order 13084 do not apply. Regulatory Flexibility Act When a Federal agency is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the agency to conduct an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA). An IRFA describes the impact of the rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603). An IRFA is not required if the agency head certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 605). The Department has prepared an IRFA for this proposed rule, summarized in this section and available at regulations.gov under Docket No. DOT-OST-2022-0109. The proposed rule would have some impact on U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers and ticket agents that qualify as small entities. It would also have some impact on Global Distribution Systems (GDSs), but none of the three major GDS companies in the market (Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport) qualify as small businesses. A carrier is a small entity if it provides air transportation exclusively with small aircraft, defined as any aircraft originally designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of 60 seats or less or a maximum payload capacity of 18,000 pounds or less, as described in 14 CFR 399.73. In 54 2020, 28 carriers meeting these criteria reported passenger traffic data to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.46 A ticket agent is a small entity if it has total annual revenues below $22 million.47 This amount excludes funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to commissions, but includes commissions received. In 2017, the latest year with available data, 7,827 travel agency establishments had annual revenues of less than $25 million.48 This number overestimates the number of small entities because some establishments may have annual revenues greater than $22 million. The proposed rule could have impacts on small entities because carriers and ticket agents would incur costs to modify websites and upgrade systems to exchange ancillary fee data. Because the Department could not estimate these costs reliably, it could not determine whether the proposed rule would impose a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Department seeks comment on the potential implementation costs of the proposed rule for small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (PRA), no person is required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The Department invites interested parties to comment on the information collection requirements contained in this document. As prescribed by the PRA, the requirement will not go into effect until OMB has approved the requirement. 46 Bureau of Transportation Statistics. No date. \u201cT1: U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Summary by Service Class.\u201d https://transtats.bts.gov/. 47 See https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards, NAICS Code 561510. 48 U.S. Census Bureau. 2022. \u201cEconomic Census.\u201d https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic- census.html. 55 This NPRM proposes three new information collections: (1) U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents must disclose, during the booking process, applicable fee information for the first and second checked baggage and for carry-on baggage, applicable fee and policy information for changing and cancelling reservations, and, for bookings that involve a passenger 13 or under, the seat fee, if any, for the child passenger to be seated next to an accompanying adult; (2) air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents must disclose their policy on 24-hour ticket hold or cancellation; and (3) air carriers and foreign air carriers must ensure that partner carriers and ticket agents receive information regarding certain baggage fees, change and cancellation fees and policies, and family seating fee so that the partner carriers and ticket agents can accurately provide such information to consumers and so that the family seating fee can be transactable at the point of ticket purchase. For each of the information collections, the title, a description of the respondents, and an estimate of the burdens are set forth below: 1. Requirement that U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose, during the booking process, the applicable fee information for the first and second checked baggage, one carry-on bag, the applicable fee and policy information for changing and canceling reservation, and the seat fee, if any, for a passenger 13 or under to be seated next to an accompanying adult. Title: Disclosure of Ancillary Fees and Policies During the Air Transportation Booking Process Respondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or display carrier fare and schedule information to consumers in the United States. Number of Respondents: We estimate that as many as 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers and as many as 600 ticket agents may be impacted by this requirement. Our estimate is 56 based on the following information and assumptions: Ticket agents includes online travel agencies (OTAs), brick-and-mortar travel agencies, corporate travel agencies, and tour operators that market airline tickets. There may be approximately 9,500 travel agencies and over 2,500 tour operators in the United States, although not all of those entities market air transportation online to consumers in the United States. In addition, most ticket agents rely on global distribution systems (GDSs) to create online fare and schedule displays. GDSs and entities that create or develop and maintain their own online fare and schedule displays, such as many of the impacted carriers and the largest travel agents, will incur some planning, development, and programming costs to reprogram their systems to provide online displays of fare and schedule information that includes baggage fee information on their websites. For these reasons, we assume that about five percent of United States ticket agents, including GDSs and large travel agencies, or as many as 600 ticket agents, would be impacted by this requirement. Many smaller carriers also rely on GDSs to create online fare and schedule displays so our estimate of 206 impacted carriers may be overstated. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 80 hours per respondent. Our estimate is based on the following information and assumptions: the primary costs to respondents for the disclosure requirement would arise from programming, data management, website modification, and other related costs to carriers and ticket agents to display the required ancillary fee information. Revising website displays in this manner would likely be similar to the revisions that carriers and ticket agents needed to make to their websites to comply with the requirement to include all taxes and fees in fare displays (\u201cfull fare rule\u201d), as prescribed by the Enhanced Airline 57 Passenger Protections II rulemaking.49 In that rulemaking, the Department estimated that compliance with the full fare rule would require approximately 80 hours per respondent.50 The burdens in this rulemaking are expected to be incurred one time by regulated entities. Once the modifications required by this information collection have been incorporated into the websites of regulated entities, we do not expect that this information collection will impose additional ongoing costs, such as website maintenance, for regulated entities who have been operating websites prior to the promulgation of this rulemaking. As currently proposed, this rulemaking would not require the creation of new websites by regulated entities that did not already maintain websites for the purpose of selling air transportation. For those entities selling air transportation through other means, such as by phone, the rule would require that such entities inform consumers about certain ancillary service fees at the time a fare is quoted. Due to the relatively marginal increase in time needed to orally convey the information required by this information collection, the burden of this information collection with respect to offline purchases of air transportation is expected to be minimal. Estimated Total Annual Burden: Approximately 64,480 hours for all respondents (based on an assumption of 16,480 hours for carriers and 48,000 hours for ticket agents). Based on an estimated mean hourly wage of $45.90 for web and digital interface designers,51 this results in a total annual cost of $2,959,632 ($756,432 for carriers and $2,203,200 for ticket agents). 49 76 Fed. Reg. 23110 (Apr. 25, 2011) 50 See Regulatory Impact Analysis on page 59, available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOT-OST- 2010-0140-2046. 51 https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151255.htm 58 Frequency: Once information is incorporated into website displays, this rulemaking would not require further modifications to websites. Ongoing website costs (such as for maintenance) are expected to be unchanged by this rulemaking. 2. Requirement that U.S. air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents disclose on their websites 24-hour hold or cancellation policies. Title: Disclosure of 24-hour hold or cancellation policy on carrier and ticket agent websites during the booking process Respondents: U.S. carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents that sell or display carrier fare and schedule information to consumers in the United States. Number of Respondents: We estimate that the same regulated entities impacted by Information Collection 1 would be impacted by this requirement. Our estimates include 206 U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers and as many as 600 ticket agents. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 80 hours per respondent. The primary costs to respondents would arise from the design, programming, and modification of websites to display 24-hour hold and cancellation policy information, which is primarily static, prior to the ticket purchase . This rulemaking would not require the creation of new websites by regulated entities that did not already maintain websites for the purpose of selling air transportation. Estimated Total Annual Burden: This information collection would result in an estimated annual burden of 48,360 hours (based on an assumption of 12,360 hours for carriers and 36,000 hours for ticket agents). 3. Requirement that U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers ensure that partner carriers and ticket agents receive information regarding certain baggage fees, change and cancellation 59 fees and policies, and family seating fee so the partner carriers and ticket agents can accurately provide such information to consumers. Title: Disclosure of baggage and other fee information to partner carriers and ticket agents Respondents: U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers that provide fare, schedule, and availability information to ticket agents to sell or display flights within, to, or from the United States. Number of Respondents: We estimate that approximately 206 carriers will be impacted by this requirement. This includes foreign carriers that may not serve the United States on their own equipment but may sell connecting itineraries between the United States and a foreign point, when at least one of the foreign-to-foreign segments is operated by the foreign carrier. Estimated Annual Burden on Respondents: Approximately 16 hours per respondent. The proposed information collection would require carriers to either distribute baggage fee and family seating information or make the specific policies, including the calculation of baggage and seat fees applicable for passenger-specific itineraries, available to third parties. Carriers selling tickets in the United States already display baggage and ancillary fee information on their websites, as required by existing regulation (14 CFR 399.85(d)). This information includes the use of baggage fee calculators and other tables accessible to consumers. The rulemaking would require that this information be made available in such a way that partner carriers and ticket agents have access to this information in a non-static, dynamic format such that the partner carriers and ticket agents can disclose baggage fee and family seating information to consumers during each itinerary search and to allow for the purchase of a seat fee for a child passenger at the same time as the ticket purchase. Because partner carriers already have mechanisms to share this information with third parties, the additional modifications that would be required by this information collection are not expected to be significant. Moreover, carriers already share this 60 information with each other (i.e., partner carriers) to facilitate codeshare and interline ticketing. This potential burden of sixteen hours per respondent, as referenced here, may overestimate the actual burden for most carriers. Estimated Total Annual Burden: This information collection would result in an estimated annual burden of 3,296 hours. Based on an estimated mean hourly wage of $46.46 for computer programmers,52 this results in a total cost of approximately $153,132. The Department invites interested persons to submit comments on any aspect of each of these information collections, including the following: (1) The necessity and utility of the information collection, (2) the accuracy of the estimate of the burden, (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected, and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collection without reducing the quality of the collected information. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized or included, or both, in the request for OMB approval of these information collections. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires, at 2 U.S.C. 1532, that agencies prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year. As described elsewhere in the preamble, this proposed rule would have no such effect on State, local, and tribal governments or on the private sector. Therefore, the Department has determined that no assessment is required pursuant to UMRA. 52 https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151251.htm 61 National Environmental Policy Act The Department has analyzed the environmental impacts of this proposed action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and has determined that it is categorically excluded pursuant to DOT Order 5610.1C, Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts (44 FR 56420, Oct. 1, 1979). Categorical exclusions are actions identified in an agency\u2019s NEPA implementing procedures that do not normally have a significant impact on the environment and therefore do not require either an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS). See 40 CFR 1508.4. In analyzing the applicability of a categorical exclusion, the agency must also consider whether extraordinary circumstances are present that would warrant the preparation of an EA or EIS. Id. Paragraph 4(c)(6)(i) of DOT Order 5610.1C provides that \u201cactions relating to consumer protection, including regulations\u201d are categorically excluded. The purpose of this rulemaking is to enhance protections for air travelers and to improve the air travel experience. The Department does not anticipate any environmental impacts, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present in connection with this rulemaking. SIGNED THIS 25th DAY OF SEPTEMBER 2022, IN WASHINGTON, D.C. -Original Signed- Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg Secretary of Transportation 62 List of Subjects 14 CFR Part 399 STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY Air carriers, Consumer Protection, Enforcement For the reasons stated in the preamble, DOT proposes to amend 14 CFR chapter 2, subchapter F as follows: Part 399 STATEMENTS OF GENERAL POLICY 1. Revise \u00a7399.80(s) to read as follows: (s) Failing to disclose and offer Web based discount fares to prospective passengers who contact the agent through other channels (e.g., by telephone or in the agent's place of business) and indicate that they are unable to use the agent\u2019s Web site due to a disability and failing to disclose ancillary service fee information (as required by 14 CFR 399.85) to prospective passengers who contact the agent through other channels (e.g., by telephone or in the agent's place of business). The disclosure of ancillary service fee information (as required by 14 CFR 399.85) must be made at the time that the schedule information is being provided to the consumer. 2. Revise \u00a7399.84(a) to read as follows: (a) The Department considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air carrier, indirect air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent, for passenger air transportation, a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations) or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation that states a price for such air transportation, tour, or tour component to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 63 U.S.C. 41712, unless the price stated is the entire price to be paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent, for such air transportation, tour, or tour component. (1) Charges included within the single total price listed (e.g., government taxes) may be stated separately or through links or \u201cpop ups\u201d on websites that display the total price, but such charges may not be false or misleading, may not be displayed prominently, may not be presented in the same or larger size as the total price, and must provide cost information on a per passenger basis that accurately reflects the cost of the item covered by the charge. (2) An airline or ticket agent may display a price that includes all mandatory charges and one or more ancillary service fees more prominently than a price that only includes all mandatory charges. 3. Revise \u00a7399.85 to read as follows: \u00a7399.85 Notice of Ancillary Service Fees. (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (1) \u201cAncillary service fee\u201d means the fee charged for any optional service the U.S. or foreign air carrier provides beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees may include, but are not limited to, charges for checked or carry-on baggage, canceling or changing a reservation, advance seat selection, in-flight beverages, snacks and meals, lounge access, bedding or other amenities, or seat upgrades. (2) \u201cAncillary service package\u201d means a package or bundle of one or more ancillary services offered for sale by a carrier or ticket agent. Such packages are typically offered after the consumer has selected an itinerary and fare category during the booking process. Carriers and ticket agents are not required to offer ancillary service packages. (3) \u201cAnonymous itinerary search\u201d means a search conducted on the website of a U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, that does not take into account information specific 64 to a characteristic of the passenger that impacts the ancillary service fees to be charged or other parameters relevant to these fees (e.g., size and weight limitations on baggage). (4) \u201cConsumer\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d means the person who uses the website of a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or ticket agent, to search for and/or purchase air transportation. \u201cConsumer\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d may also refer to a person who seeks to obtain information about air transportation, whether through a website or other means. (5) \u201cPassenger-specific itinerary search\u201d means a search conducted on the website of a U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent that takes into account information specific to a characteristic of the passenger that may impact the ancillary service fees to be charged or other parameters relevant to these fees (e.g., size and weight limitations on baggage). Such information could include the passenger\u2019s status in the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, the passenger\u2019s military status, or the passenger\u2019s status as a holder of a particular credit card. An itinerary search is \u201cpassenger-specific\u201d when a user has provided passenger-specific information prior to conducting the search, including when conducting previous searches if the information is cached, or if the user conducts a search while logged into the search website and the operating entity of that website has passenger-specific information as part of the user\u2019s profile. (b) Online fee disclosures of baggage. Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must accurately display (or cause to be displayed) the fee that applies, if any, to an itinerary for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and a carry-on bag. The fees must be included on the first page displayed when a consumer conducts a search for air transportation when fare and schedule information is shown. Display of the baggage fee by links or rollovers is not permitted. Ancillary service fees other than those referenced in this paragraph may also be displayed on the same 65 page, at the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s discretion. All fees displayed must be the total to be paid by the consumer for the ancillary service. (1) Consumers must be offered both the option to conduct a passenger-specific itinerary search and the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search. For passenger-specific itinerary searches, the fees required to be displayed under \u00a7399.85(b) must be adjusted to reflect accurately the itinerary of the passenger, the fare category displayed or selected, and the status of the passenger. For anonymous itinerary searches, the fees required to be displayed under \u00a7399.85(b) must be adjusted to reflect accurately the itinerary of the passenger and the fare category displayed or selected, without taking into account passenger-specific information. (3) If the carrier or ticket agent displays multiple fare categories for the same flight in response to an itinerary search (e.g., the search results page displays basic economy, restricted economy, flexible economy, and business class fares simultaneously for the same flight), the carrier or ticket agent must display the bag fees applicable to each fare category associated with that fee. In circumstances where a particular fare category prohibits the checking of a bag or the carriage of a carry-on bag, the carrier or ticket agent must indicate that the item is prohibited under the fare category and display the penalty, if applicable, for carrying on or checking the item. (4) If the carrier does not display any fee for a first or second checked or carry-on bag at the time the consumer searches for and purchases air transportation, the carrier may not impose a fee on the consumer for a checked or carry-on bag following the ticket purchase. If a ticket agent does not display any fee for a checked or carry-on bag at the time the consumer searches for and 66 purchases air transportation, the ticket agent must promptly refund the consumer for any bag fee the carrier imposes on the consumer for the itinerary. (5) In displaying the applicable bag fee required by \u00a7399.85(b), each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, must display the weight and dimension limitations that the carrier imposes for each checked bag and carry-on bag. Such limitation information may be displayed using links or pop-ups adjacent to the display of the bag fee. For passenger-specific itinerary searches, the weight and dimension limitations must be adjusted to the level applicable to the passenger based on the passenger-specific information provided. (6) If a carrier or ticket agent offers for sale an ancillary service package that includes baggage, it may display the package and the package price in addition to the standalone bag fees, if any, already required under 14 CFR 399.85(b)(1). (7) For air-tour packages sold online by ticket agents where the carrier providing air transportation is not known at the time of booking, ticket agents are not required to provide specific baggage fee information as required by \u00a7399.85(b). In such cases, the ticket agent must clearly and prominently disclose on the first screen in which the ticket agent offers a package fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a consumer that additional airline fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. Once the carrier providing air transportation for an air-tour package is known, the ticket agent must provide baggage fee information as prescribed by \u00a7399.85(b) both to prospective consumers and to 67 consumers who purchased the air-tour package before the identity of the carrier providing the air transportation became known. (c) Online Disclosure of Cancellation and Change Fees. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must accurately display, on the first page when a consumer conducts a search for air transportation and fare and schedule information is shown, the applicable fee for the consumer to change the reservation and cancel the reservation. Display of the cancellation and change fee by links or rollovers is not permitted. The fee displayed must be specific to each fare category displayed and adjusted based on passenger-specific information provided by the consumer. The carrier or ticket agent must also display the following information, which may be with the use of links or pop-ups adjacent to the pertinent fee: (1) a summary of the applicable cancellation policy for the itinerary displayed, adjusted based on the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific and itinerary-specific information provided, if applicable; and (2) a summary of the applicable ticket change policy for the itinerary displayed, adjusted based on the consumer\u2019s passenger-specific and itinerary-specific information provided, if applicable. (d) Online Disclosure of 24-Hour Change and Cancellation Policy. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it sells air transportation must display a statement, before the consumer can execute his or her purchase or reservation of air transportation, indicating whether the consumer\u2019s booking can be cancelled without penalty within 24 hours of booking, or whether the consumer has the option to hold the 68 reservation for 24 hours at the quoted price without executing the purchase, consistent with the carrier or ticket agent\u2019s policy and, for carriers, consistent with 14 CFR 259.5(b)(4). (e) Online Disclosure and Transactability of Family Seating Fee. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must disclose to each consumer seeking to purchase air transportation in which at least one passenger is 13 years of age or under, wherever fare and schedule information is provided, the fee, if any, for the passenger age 13 years or under to be seated adjacent to the seat of an accompanying adult in the same class of service. This fee must be displayed alongside the quoted fare associated with each itinerary search result. Display of the family seating fee by links or rollovers is not permitted. Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it sells air transportation must also enable the consumer to select and purchase the seat at the time the seat fee is disclosed if the consumer chooses to do so. (f) Disclosures for tickets not purchased online. For tickets purchased by consumers in the United States in person or by phone, each U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, and ticket agent must disclose to consumers the baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and family seating fees (i.e., the fee for a passenger 13 or under to obtain a seat next to an accompanying adult, if the carrier imposes such a fee and the consumer\u2019s intended booking includes a passenger age 13 or under) that apply at the time a fare is quoted for an itinerary. The fees disclosed must be adjusted based on passenger-specific information provided by the consumer. (g) Changes in baggage fees. If a U.S. or foreign air carrier has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation, the carrier must promptly and 69 prominently disclose any increase in its fee for carry-on or first and second checked bags and any change in the first and second checked bags or carry-on allowance for a passenger on the homepage of that website (e.g., provide a link that says \u201cchanged bag rules\u201d or similarly descriptive language and takes the consumer from the homepage directly to a pop-up or a place on another webpage that details the change in baggage allowance or fees and the effective dates of such changes). Such notice must remain on the homepage for at least three months after the change becomes effective. (h) Disclosures of baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations. A U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, an agent of either, or a ticket agent that advertises or sells air transportation in the United States, must include information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance and/or the applicable fee for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation within, to or from the United States. This requirement applies to all tickets sold on a website marketed to U.S. consumers where the carrier or agent advertises or sells such air transportation, including the summary page at the completion of an online purchase and a post- purchase  confirmation. (1) Carriers must provide this information in the e-ticket confirmation. Ticket agents may provide this information in text form in the e-ticket confirmations or through a hyperlink to the specific location on airline websites or their own website where this information is displayed. (2) The fee information provided for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any passenger-specific factors that affect those charges. (i) Website disclosure of all ancillary service fees. If a U.S. or foreign air carrier has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation, the carrier must 70 prominently disclose on its website information on ancillary service fees available to a passenger purchasing air transportation. Such disclosure must be clear, with a conspicuous link from the carrier's homepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such ancillary services and related fees are disclosed. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however, baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (e.g., frequent flyer status, early purchase) that affect those charges. (j) Fee information distribution to ticket agents. (1) For air transportation within, to, or from the United States, each U.S. and foreign air carrier that provides fare, schedule, and availability information to ticket agents to sell or display the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers, must provide such ticket agents useable, current, and accurate information of the fee rules for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, one carry-on bag, canceling a reservation, and changing a reservation. The information provided by the carrier must be sufficient to enable the ticket agent to comply with the baggage disclosure requirements in \u00a7399.85(b) and the change and cancellation disclosure requirements in \u00a7399.85(c). Carriers have no obligation to ensure that these fees are transactable by ticket agents; and (2) For air transportation within, to, or from the United States, each U.S. and foreign air carrier that provides fare, schedule, and availability information to ticket agents to sell or display the carrier\u2019s flights directly to consumers must provide such ticket agents useable, current, and accurate information of the fee rules for aircraft seats if the carrier charges a fee for a child, who is age 13 or under on the date an applicable flight is scheduled to occur, to be seated in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying adult.. The aircraft seat fee information must be detailed enough to enable the ticket agent to disclose the applicable fees for adjacent seats for each flight in the itinerary of a child, who is age 13 or under on the date an applicable flight is scheduled to 71 occur, as set forth in \u00a7399.85(e). Carriers must ensure that seat fees are transactable by ticket agents. (k) The Department considers the failure to provide and adhere to the disclosures required by this section to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712. The Department also considers the practice of collecting a fee from consumers for critical ancillary services (i.e., first and second checked bags, one carry-on item, canceling or changing a reservation, adjacent seats when traveling with a child who is 13 years of age or under) without disclosure of this fee when fare and schedule information is provided to be an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712. Any fee that has been collected from consumers for critical ancillary services must be refunded to consumers by the seller of the air transportation if disclosures required by this section were not provided. 4. Revise \u00a7399.88(a) to read as follows: (a) It is an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 for any seller of scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, or of a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that includes scheduled air transportation within, to or from the United States, to increase the ticket price of that air transportation, tour or tour component or to apply revised price rules for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and one carry-on bag to a consumer, after the air transportation has been purchased by the consumer, except in the case of an increase in a government-imposed tax or fee. A purchase is deemed to have occurred when the full amount agreed upon has been paid by the consumer. 72"
