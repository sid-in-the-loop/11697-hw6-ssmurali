Air Canada is removing carry-ons from Basic Tickets. AC has their reasons and we can have an informed discussion on how this is good or bad for the airline. However, posts simply bitching about the new policy will be removed as per rule 1. Let's try to keep the discussion in here if we can or on one of the already established threads. It won't be as strict as during the strike but let's see how it goes. EDIT: If you'd like some into why airlines do things like this, I highly recommend the podcast Airlines Confidential. https://airlinesconfidential.com/ Unfortunately, host , airline LEGEND and former Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza recently passed away from complications due to ALS. However, Scott Mcartney, a former Airline journalist and just a juggernaut of industry knowledge, is keeping it going. Give it a listen. Here are the particulars: Air Canada Economy Basic fare tickets purchased on or after January 3, 2025, will no longer include carry-on baggage. Customers will only be permitted to bring one (1) personal article when travelling: within Canada to and from the U.S. (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico) to and from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Standard baggage fare rules apply. Starting January 21, 2025, the new Basic fare will still include complimentary seat assignment at check-in for customers who have not paid a fee to select their seats in advance. https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2024/carry-on-baggage.html#/  Share Related Answers Section Related Answers Air Canada personal item guidelines Air Canada hand baggage weight limits Best tips for booking Air Canada flights How to maximize Aeroplan points effectively Challenges faced while flying with Air Canada Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 0 0 Top Posts Reddit reReddit: Top posts of December 4, 2024 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of December 2024 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of 2024 See this post in...
