This results in having a longer journey time, however, it’s quite common when direct services are not available.If you have a connecting flight booked on the same ticket, typically your baggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, with potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight connections, you might make the connection, but often your baggage does not.
