That’s why one of the first things you should do before travelling is to double-check the carry on luggage size allowed by the airline you're flying with. This guide will give you domestic and international carry-on size charts, covering major airlines in the US, UK, EU, and parts of Asia. We’ll also explain how to distinguish between a carry on bag and a personal item. All of this will help you get through airport checks smoothly – and avoid paying extra for oversized baggage. What Is Carry On? Carry-on is a simple way of referring to the items you’re allowed to take with you into the cabin when you board a flight. These items, often dubbed cabin bags or hand luggage, typically are small backpacks, tote bags, or compact suitcases. Inside, you might pack personal essentials like a change of clothes, toiletries, travel documents, your phone, laptop, and other small valuables (basically in-flight essentials). Your carry-on needs to fit under the seat in front of you. Unlike checked baggage, which goes in the aircraft’s hold, carry-on luggage stays with you during the flight. You can store it either in the overhead locker above your seat or under the seat in front of you. Some even travel with a carry-on only as they find this approach more liberating than sticking to a wheeled suitcase. Because space is limited in these areas, airlines usually set size and weight limits to ensure comfort and safety for everyone onboard. Many travellers often wonder, “Can a 24 inch bag be a carry-on?” The answer depends on the airline. Most carriers allow a maximum length of 22 inches (around 56cm), including handles and wheels. However, some airlines (like Southwest) may accept bags up to 24 inches (roughly 61cm), as long as they meet the overall size and weight restrictions. Below, you’ll find a handy summary of cabin bag rules from nearly 60 popular airlines around the world. We’ve highlighted each airline’s restrictions in detail, and also noted whether they allow personal items (more on that in the next section).

And wondering, “What size bag is TSA approved for carry-on?” In general, the TSA allows carry-on luggage no more than 22 inches (about 56 cm), including handles and wheels. While the TSA does not set a weight restriction for hand bags, most American airlines do. Refer to the following information to prepare for your trip: Airline Free Items Allowed Carry‑On Size (cm/in) Personal Item (cm/in) Weight Limit Notes Delta Air Lines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 56×35×23 cm (22×14×9 in) 45×35×20 cm (18×14×8 in) No explicit weight limit Basic Economy = personal item only (travelpander.com) American Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 56×36×23 cm (22×14×9 in) 45×35×20 cm (18×14×8 in) No explicit weight limit Smaller aircraft may vary Jetblue Airways 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 55.8×35.56×22.9 cm (22×14×9 in) 43.2×33×20.32 cm (17×13×8 in) No weight limit; lift required “Blue Basic” = personal item only United Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item (Basic* excl.) 56×35×23 cm (22×14×9 in) 22×25 x 43 cm (9×10×17 inches) No limit Basic Economy: carry‑on restricted (upgradedpoints.com) Southwest Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 61×41×25 cm (24×16×10 in) 46×21×34 cm (18.5×8.5×13.5 in) No limit Most generous size limit Alaska Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 56×35.6×22.9 cm (22×14×9 in) fits under the seat No limit; must lift into the bin Linear dims ≤ 45in Spirit 1 personal item included; carry‑on for fee 56×46×25 cm (22×18×10 in) 45×35×20 cm (18×14×8 in) - Fees apply; buy early Frontier Airlines Carry‑on only with fare/bundle 61×40×25 cm (24×16×10 in) 46×36×10 cm (18×14×8 in) Max 15 kg (35 lbs) Fare class matters Aeromexico 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item Standard 55×40×25 cm (22×16×10 in) Standard - Aligns with US standards Air Canada 1 personal item; carry‑on for fee (Basic) 55×40×23 cm (22×16×9 in) 33×16×43 cm (13×6×17 in) - Carry‑on fee C$35–50 Basic Allegiant Air 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 55×40×25 cm (22×16×10 in) 20×35×45 cm (8×14×18 in) - Same as US legacy Latam Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 55×35×25 cm (21.7×13.8×9.8 in) Standard Economy: 12 kg (26 lbs);Premium Economy/Business: 16 kg (35 lbs) Aligns with international norms Sun Country Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 61×41×28 cm (24×16×11 in) Standard 15 kg (35 lbs) Same as US legacy Westjet 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 56×36×23 cm (22×14×9 in) 41×33×16 cm (16×13×6 in) - Similar to Canadian norms Porter Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 55×40×23 cm (22×16×9 in) 33×43×16 cm (13×17×6 in) - Regionals may vary Air Transat 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 51×40×23 cm (20×16×9 in) 43×31×13 cm (17×12×5 in) Economy: 10 kg (22 lbs); Club: 15 kg (33 lbs) Standard for Canadians SkyWest Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item Depends on major partner:56×36×23 cm (22×14×9 in) 43×33×20 cm (17×13×8 in) 7 kg (15 lbs) Regional USA partner Hawaiian Airlines 1 carry‑on + 1 personal item 56×36×23 cm (22×14×9 in) fits under the seat 11 kg (25 lbs) Same as US legacy So, “Can I take a 22.5 inch carry-on bag Delta?” — The answer is: probably not. Delta’s carry-on size limit is 22 inches, so a 22.5-inch bag may be refused at the gate if it doesn’t fit within those dimensions.

So what should you bring as your carry-on?Technically, you can use almost any bag as your carry-on. A wheeled suitcase, a tote, even a small duffel. But here’s the thing: it still has to fit your airline’s carry on luggage size limits. And those rules? They’re not always the same, and not always easy to figure out.So why make things harder than they need to be? Skip the stress of measuring and second-guessing. All you really need is a CabinZero backpack.Our bags are designed to fit the carry-on size rules of most major airlines, including 40x20x25 cm, 40x30x20 cm, 45x36x20 cm, and 55x40x20 cm. And the best part? There’s still plenty of room to pack everything you need for several days away.

Check the Dimension Before Your FlightMost airlines allow carry-on bags up to 22 inches (56 cm) tall, 18 inches (45 cm) wide, and 10 inches (25 cm) deep. And that includes any wheels, top handles, and any side pockets.But that doesn’t mean you can skip checking. We always recommend that you visit your airline’s website before your trip to double-check the allowed carry-on luggage size. It only takes a minute, and it can save you a lot of trouble at the airport.Some low-cost airlines (like Ryanair or Wizz Air) are known for having stricter size rules. They do this to reduce overhead bin use and speed up boarding. In contrast, full-service airlines such as British Airways or Qatar Airways might offer a bit more flexibility, especially if you’re flying business or first class.In case you're unsure how to measure your bag, here's how we measure ours:Start by placing your bag on a table or some other flat surface. Stand it upright with telescopic handles (if any) retracted.Measure the height from the top of the bag (the top handle usually) to the ground. Don't forget to include the wheels!Measure the width by taking the bag from side to side at its widest point:For hard-shell bags, you can place the bag on its back and measure across.For backpacks or soft-sided bags, it’s better to place the bag as you would normally carry it, and then measure across the widest point. Just remember to include any side pockets or straps that stick out. This will give you a more accurate idea of your carry on luggage size and how much space the bag takes up when fully packed.Take the depth from the rear of the bag to the front, accounting for any expanded areas or bulging due to packing.Once you’ve got the height, width, and depth, just add them together. That will give you the total linear size. After packing, your bag still needs to fit within the airline’s limit.The more accurately you measure your bag, the easier it is to follow airline rules.2. Don’t Forget Weight LimitIf your hand luggage is too big, there’s a chance the airline crew might stop you at the gate. They may also ask you to put it in the hold with the checked bags. Either way, it’s best to go for hand luggage that’s light enough for you to lift and stow in the overhead compartment without a struggle.Just like with the carry on luggage size, always double-check the weight allowance on your airline’s official website before your flight. The most common way to weigh your hand luggage is by using a home scale: either a luggage scale, a bathroom scale, or a mix of both.A quick tip: Try to keep your bag at least 1.3 kg lighter than the airline’s maximum hand luggage allowance. That’s because home scales and airport scales might not always give the same reading. It’s better to be safe than sorry!Now, think about what suits your journey best. It could be a small suitcase or a travel backpack with a laptop compartment. Just make sure it fits within your airline’s carry on luggage size limits. The key here is to pick one that’s as lightweight as possible when empty, like a CabinZero backpack, which can weigh as little as 600g. That will give you more freedom to pack what you really need without wasting precious weight on the bag itself.3. Pack SmartWhat’s more, here are a few simple tricks that can come in handy if you want to travel light with just a carry-on and still fit in as much as possible:Use packing cubes - They help keep things tidy and compress your clothes so you can fit more. We also use them to separate clean and dirty clothes, shoes, or even to store electronics safely away from moisture.Make better use of space with packing cubes by CabinZero.Avoid overpacking or bringing unnecessary items - Don’t throw anything ‘just in case’ into your carry-on luggage. A well-organised carry-on is easier to carry, and it’ll give you more room to bring back souvenirs.Wear your heaviest or chunkiest clothes on the plane - like a thick coat, hiking boots or chunky trainers. And if you don’t mind a bit of heat or a few curious stares at the airport, layer up with a few extra shirts or trousers. There’s nothing wrong with getting around baggage fees, as long as it’s within the rules!Use a TSA-approved lock - On full or smaller regional flights, airlines frequently run out of overhead bin space and require passengers to gate-check their carry-on bags at the last minute. When your bag leaves your possession to go into the hold, you will want it to be securely locked.4. Know The Differences Between Carry On vs Personal ItemsThe most important difference between a carry on bag and a personal item is size, specifically your airline's carry on luggage size. A carry-on is usually bigger and will fit in the overhead compartment, while a personal item is smaller and will fit under the seat in front of you.Wrapping UpTurns out, getting your head around carry on luggage size rules isn’t that tricky after all, right? You can save the size chart we've shared in this post, or simply take a few minutes to check your airline’s website before you start packing. And one more thing – why not choose a CabinZero bag as your travel buddy? Our designs fit even the strictest airline rules. From today on, pack more and stress less! FAQs Which Items Can And Can't I Take In Hand Luggage? In general, most everyday items are allowed in your hand luggage. These can include clothes, a few prescribed medicines, baby essentials, perfume and liquid toiletries in containers no larger than 100ml. Laptops and tablets are also fine to carry in your cabin bag. Anything outside of these basics is usually not allowed. Especially sharp or pointed objects with blades over 6 cm, flammable items (like fireworks), or anything that could be used as a weapon. What Happens If My Carry-On Is Too Big? If your bag goes over the allowed carry on luggage size, the airline will likely ask you to check it in at the gate – and yes, you’ll probably have to pay a fee. The amount depends on the airline and your destination. But it’s usually more expensive than if you had booked checked baggage in advance with your ticket. Is There A Standard International Carry-On Size? Not really. While most major airlines around the world allow carry-on bags up to around 56 cm (22 inches), some low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe can be stricter, with limits closer to 53 cm (21 inches). So the best thing you can do is check your airline’s rules before you fly.
