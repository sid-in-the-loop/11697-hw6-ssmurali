When you book with us, we automatically generate the necessary customs documentation for you to complete online.Below, we’ve outlined some key points and frequently asked questions regarding customs when shipping to Australia. While we aim to offer guidance, we recommend conducting your own research with Australian customs to ensure you have the most relevant information for your specific situation.Will my shipment to Australia be subject to customs checks?Yes, all international shipments sent to Australia are subject to customs checks. It's essential to include a complete customs form with your shipment.When you book with My Baggage, we simplify the customs process for you.

What is the customs processing time for shipments to Australia?The customs processing time for shipments to Australia can vary as each shipment is unique and subject to inspection by Australian customs officials. Several factors influence the processing time, including the nature of your shipment and the accuracy of the customs forms you submit.Typically, if all customs paperwork is completed accurately and no prohibited items are included in your shipment, your items shipped with My Baggage should clear customs without delay.

In addition to the customs forms generated by My Baggage, you will also need to provide a copy of the passport's image page of the recipient. In addition, you must complete a B534 form, which will be included with your customs paperwork.To avoid potential issues, it is crucial that all documentation required by customs is in the name of the recipient, who should be the owner of the shipment. If any documents are in the sender's name and differ from the recipient's name, customs may reject the shipment.When sending personal effects, ensure that the names of both the sender and the recipient match those of the shipment's owner.Remember that each shipment is unique, and individual circumstances may vary. As such, Australian customs may request additional documentation to facilitate the clearance of your shipment.Do I have to declare the value of my items that I’m shipping to Australia?When completing your customs forms for your shipment to Australia, it is essential to accurately and clearly declare the value of each item you are sending. This declaration helps demonstrate that your shipment consists of used personal effects, which can facilitate the customs clearance process.To ensure clarity, provide specific details about each item. For example, you might declare:4 x Men’s Used Cotton T-Shirts (Colour: White)1 x Pair of Used Men’s Brown Leather Shoes (Size 8)2 x Dark Blue Used Men’s Denim Jeans (Size Medium)Being thorough and precise in your declarations will help prevent any delays or issues with your shipment at customs.Will I have to pay customs fees when shipping to Australia?Customs fees may apply when shipping to Australia, but this depends on several factors, including the accuracy of the values declared on your customs forms. If customs fees are due, our courier partner will contact you with a detailed breakdown of the charges. You can then pay these fees online or over the phone through our courier partner, who will coordinate with Australian Customs to expedite the clearance process and ensure your shipment is delivered as quickly as possible.When sending gifts to Australia from the USA, shipments valued at up to $1,000 AUD can be sent without incurring customs fees. Generally, low-value shipments of personal effects are exempt from such fees.However, if your gift exceeds $1,000 AUD or if you’re sending multiple gifts with a combined value exceeding this amount, applicable duties and taxes will apply. To avoid unexpected costs, it’s advisable to accurately declare the value of your items on the customs forms.Is there anything else I should consider when shipping to Australia?There are several important factors to consider when shipping to Australia. All shipments are thoroughly inspected by Australian Customs, and items that pose a biosecurity risk, such as food products or wooden items, may be subject to additional scrutiny. This could lead to delays of up to 10 days or more, and additional fees may apply.It is also crucial to ensure that all items being shipped are thoroughly cleaned, as dirt or contaminants can cause complications during customs clearance.

Taking these precautions can help ensure a smoother shipping experience and minimise potential delays.Preparing your Shipment to AustraliaWhen preparing your shipment to Australia, it’s crucial to review the following information carefully. You must not ship any prohibited items to Australia, as this may lead to delays, returns, or disposal of your shipment.

When relocating, it's essential to consider all available alternatives that align with your requirements. Here are some alternative shipping solutions to explore when sending items to Australia.International Removals to AustraliaIf you and your family are moving to Australia to start a new life and have many possessions to bring - like furniture and numerous personal items - you might want to consider using an international removals company. This way, you can transport all your belongings in one go.Sea Freight to AustraliaIf you don’t have an entire household to ship to Australia but do have a few large items like a sofa, refrigerator, or even a car, you might opt to use cargo ships in large shipping containers. Keep in mind that shipping by sea can be quite slow, and you might be without your belongings for up to two months, depending on the service.While sea freight is generally much more affordable than air freight, you also need to consider the costs of transporting your items to and from the ports, both at departure and upon arrival in Australia. These additional expenses can add up.Air Freight to AustraliaLike sea freight, air freight allows you to ship large and bulky items that might be challenging to transport otherwise. While air freight is much faster than sea freight, it’s usually more expensive because it’s priced by weight and volume. Additionally, you'll need to factor in the costs of transporting your items to and from the airports, just as you would with sea freight.Get a quoteCollect fromUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d’IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunion, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweDeliver toUK - MainlandUK - Northern IrelandUK - Highlands and IslandsUnited States of America----------------IrelandFranceGermanyItalySpainNetherlandsNorwaySwedenAustraliaCanada----------------AlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAngolaAnguillaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCape Verde IslandsCayman IslandsChileChinaComoros IslandsCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d’IvoireCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFijiFinlandFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaGabonGambiaGeorgiaGhanaGibraltarGreeceGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHonduras Rep.Hong KongHungaryIcelandIndonesiaJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKenyaKiribatiKorea (South)KuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLiberiaLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueNamibiaNepalNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNorthern Mariana IslandsOmanPakistanPalauPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPhilippinesPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunion, Island ofRomaniaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSri LankaSurinameSwazilandSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUnited Arab EmiratesUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, USZambiaZimbabweGet QuoteMy Baggage: Door to Door Shipping ExpertsLuggage ShippingShip your baggage anywhere in the world with us.
