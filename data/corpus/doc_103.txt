When you book a bag on your flight, you have to keep in mind the airline's restrictive baggage weight allowances when packing up all of your personal belongings. It could mean that you may have to make the sacrifice that no student wants to make; leaving some of your beloved belongings behind. Even then, you might still be faced with a nasty surprise at the check-in desk, meaning you'll have to cough up extortionate excess baggage fees anyway. And, when you're getting by on a student budget, it's certainly not ideal. Thankfully, My Baggage allows you to ship a massive 30kg/66lbs per box or suitcase at fantastic low rates. You'll also have the option to pay extra for even heavier bags, if you need to. With My Baggage, you won't have to worry about leaving anything behind as you embark on your international adventure.

Customs Information When shipping within the EU, goods do not pass through customs clearance and are therefore do not require customs documentation and are not subject to import tax or duty. If, however, you're sending to or from a country outside of the EU, such as Canada or the USA, you are then legally required to complete customs documentation for your shipment. When sending outside of the EU, if your shipment does not have customs documentation attached, it will not make it past your local country border, and you may have to pay return charges to get it back. My Baggage will automatically provide you with the appropriate customs documentation for you to complete, print, sign and attach to your shipment.
